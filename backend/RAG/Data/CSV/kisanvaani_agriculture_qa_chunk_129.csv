How can i improve fertility of soil for proper production of maize without application of fertilizer,"Organic matter incorporation: Increase the organic matter content of the soil by incorporating organic materials such as compost, farmyard manure, cover crops, or crop residues.

Crop rotation and diversification: Rotate maize with leguminous crops (such as beans, peas, or clover) that fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and improve soil nitrogen levels. Crop rotation also helps break pest and disease cycles and promotes overall soil health.

Green manure cover crops: Plant cover crops like clover, vetch, or hairy vetch during fallow periods. These cover crops add organic matter, prevent soil erosion, and improve soil structure.

Mulching: Apply organic mulch, such as straw or crop residues, to the soil surface. Mulching helps conserve soil moisture, suppress weed growth, and slowly release nutrients into the soil as it decomposes."
