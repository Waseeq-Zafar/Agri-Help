how can farmers mitigate leaf shedding in cassava during the dry season,"Irrigation: Providing supplemental irrigation to cassava plants during dry periods can help alleviate water stress and maintain adequate soil moisture levels.

Mulching: Applying organic mulch around the cassava plants can help conserve soil moisture, regulate soil temperature, and reduce water evaporation from the soil surface.

Fertilization: Ensuring optimal nutrient levels through balanced fertilization can help maintain the health and vigor of cassava plants, reducing the risk of nutrient deficiencies and associated leaf shedding.

Explain how agronomic practices can be used to impact on the extent of damage done by crop pests? ,"Crop rotation: Rotating crops helps disrupt the life cycles of pests and reduces the buildup of pest populations. By alternating different crops in the same field, pests that are specific to a particular crop are less likely to persist and cause significant damage.

Proper planting time and spacing: Planting crops at the appropriate time and with the correct spacing can promote healthy plant growth and vigor. Well-spaced plants have better air circulation, reducing the favorable conditions for pests and diseases to spread. Timely planting can also help avoid critical pest infestation periods.

Field sanitation: Proper field sanitation involves removing crop residues, weeds, and other debris from the field. These residues can harbor pests and diseases, providing a breeding ground for future infestations. Removing crop debris and maintaining clean field conditions can help reduce pest populations.

Use of resistant or tolerant varieties: Planting crop varieties that have natural resistance or tolerance to specific pests can greatly reduce pest damage. Resistant varieties have built-in genetic traits that make them less susceptible to pest attacks. By choosing and planting resistant or tolerant varieties, farmers can minimize the impact of pests on their crops."

Slow to warm up: Clay soils can be slow to warm up in the spring, which can delay planting and crop growth.
Prone to compaction: Clay soils are prone to compaction, which can reduce soil aeration and root growth."

The organic matter in FYM also acts as a binding agent, preventing soil particles from compacting and reducing the risk of waterlogging."
 can delaying weeding cassava cause cassava mosaic,"Delaying weeding in cassava fields can create favorable conditions for the spread of Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD). Weeds can act as alternative hosts for the whiteflies that transmit the virus responsible for CMD. When weeds are left to grow and multiply in the cassava field, they can attract whiteflies and serve as a reservoir for the virus. These whiteflies can then spread the virus to the cassava plants, leading to infection and the development of mosaic symptoms."

Nutrient recycling: The decomposition of maize stalks can release nutrients back into the soil, making them available for future crops.
Erosion control: The presence of stalks can help prevent soil erosion by reducing surface runoff and protecting the soil from wind and water erosion.

Cow dung is a good source of organic matter and nutrients that can improve soil health and provide the necessary nutrients for plant growth.

However, if you had applied a large amount of cow dung in the previous season and the soil is still rich in organic matter, you may not need to apply more cow dung. Over-application of organic matter can lead to nutrient imbalances and other soil problems. Therefore, it is important to consider the current nutrient status of the soil before adding more organic matter."
