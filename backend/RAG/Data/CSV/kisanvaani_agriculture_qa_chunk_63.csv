Which type of seed is resistant to pests and diseases,"Hybrid seeds: Hybrid seeds are produced by cross-breeding two or more distinct plant varieties to create a new variety with desirable traits, such as disease and pest resistance.

Genetically modified (GM) seeds: GM seeds have been genetically altered to express certain traits, such as resistance to specific pests or diseases. For example, Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) maize has been genetically modified to produce a protein toxic to certain insect pests.

Heirloom or heritage seeds: Heirloom or heritage seeds are non-hybrid seeds that have been passed down from generation to generation, often for centuries. These seeds have developed natural resistance to local pests and diseases over time.

Open-pollinated seeds: Open-pollinated seeds are non-hybrid seeds that have been pollinated by natural means, such as wind or insects. These seeds can be genetically diverse and may exhibit natural resistance to pests and diseases."
