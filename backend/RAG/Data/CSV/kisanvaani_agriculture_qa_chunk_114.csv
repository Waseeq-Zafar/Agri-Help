How can i improve fertility of soil for proper production of maize without application of fertilizer,"Organic matter incorporation: Increase the organic matter content of the soil by incorporating organic materials such as compost, farmyard manure, cover crops, or crop residues. This improves soil structure, enhances nutrient retention, and promotes microbial activity.

Crop rotation and diversification: Rotate maize with leguminous crops (such as beans, peas, or clover) that fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and improve soil nitrogen levels. Crop rotation also helps break pest and disease cycles and promotes overall soil health.

Green manure cover crops: Plant cover crops like clover, vetch, or hairy vetch during fallow periods. These cover crops add organic matter, prevent soil erosion, and improve soil structure.

Mulching: Apply organic mulch, such as straw or crop residues, to the soil surface. Mulching helps conserve soil moisture, suppress weed growth, and slowly release nutrients into the soil as it decomposes."

Farmers always ask for the reason why nitrogenous fertilizer are only top dress,"Nitrogen uptake timing: Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and is necessary for various physiological processes, including leaf and stem development. However, nitrogen is a highly mobile nutrient in the soil and can easily leach or wash away if applied too early in the growing season. Therefore, to ensure that the plants have an adequate and readily available nitrogen supply during their active growth phase, nitrogenous fertilizers are often applied as top dressing when the plants are well-established.

Crop demand for nitrogen: Many crops, including maize, have a high demand for nitrogen during their vegetative growth stage. By applying nitrogenous fertilizers as top dressing during this period, it helps meet the crop's nutrient requirements when they need it the most. This timing allows for optimal nitrogen utilization by the plants and promotes vigorous vegetative growth.

Minimizing nitrogen losses: By applying nitrogenous fertilizers as top dressing, farmers can better manage and minimize nitrogen losses from leaching or volatilization. Top dressing allows for a more targeted application directly to the root zone, reducing the risk of nutrient runoff or wastage. It also ensures that the nitrogen remains available to the plants when they require it, improving nutrient efficiency and minimizing environmental impacts."
Why  does cassava doesn't yield better in wetlands,"Cassava roots require well-drained soils with good aeration.

Farmers always ask what do they do to store beans safely,"Clean the beans: Remove any debris or foreign matter from the beans, such as leaves, stones, or twigs. This can be done by hand or with a sieve.

Dry the beans: Spread the beans out on a clean, dry surface to allow them to dry completely. This will help prevent mold growth and spoilage.

Store in a cool, dry place: Beans should be stored in a cool, dry place with good air circulation, such as a pantry or a cool basement. Avoid storing them in a damp or humid environment, as this can promote mold growth.

Use airtight containers: Store beans in airtight containers such as plastic bags, glass jars or metal containers with tight lids. This will help keep out moisture and pests.

Explain how agronomic practices can be used to impact on the extent of damage done by crop pests? ,"Crop rotation: Rotating crops helps disrupt the life cycles of pests and reduces the buildup of pest populations. By alternating different crops in the same field, pests that are specific to a particular crop are less likely to persist and cause significant damage.

Proper planting time and spacing: Planting crops at the appropriate time and with the correct spacing can promote healthy plant growth and vigor. Well-spaced plants have better air circulation, reducing the favorable conditions for pests and diseases to spread. Timely planting can also help avoid critical pest infestation periods.

Field sanitation: Proper field sanitation involves removing crop residues, weeds, and other debris from the field. These residues can harbor pests and diseases, providing a breeding ground for future infestations. Removing crop debris and maintaining clean field conditions can help reduce pest populations.

Use of resistant or tolerant varieties: Planting crop varieties that have natural resistance or tolerance to specific pests can greatly reduce pest damage. Resistant varieties have built-in genetic traits that make them less susceptible to pest attacks. By choosing and planting resistant or tolerant varieties, farmers can minimize the impact of pests on their crops."

list symptoms of maize streak disease.,"Stunted growth: Infected maize plants often exhibit stunted growth compared to healthy plants. The plants may fail to reach their normal height and size.

Chlorotic streaks or stripes: One of the characteristic symptoms of maize streak virus is the appearance of chlorotic streaks or stripes on the leaves. These streaks are usually pale yellow to white in color and run parallel to the leaf veins.

Necrosis or browning: As the infection progresses, the chlorotic streaks may turn necrotic or brown. This necrosis can extend to the entire leaf blade, resulting in a scorched or burnt appearance.

Leaf curling and twisting: Infected maize leaves may exhibit curling and twisting, with a downward or upward curling of the leaf margins. This distortion is more prominent in severe infections.

Reduced grain production: Maize plants infected with maize streak virus often experience a reduction in grain production. Infected plants may have fewer or smaller ears, and the kernels may be poorly developed or discolored.
