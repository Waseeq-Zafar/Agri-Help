The 'weak-ring' refers to a flexible joint in the digester's masonry between the lower water-proof and upper gas-proof parts of the structure.,What does the term 'weak-ring' refer to in the context of a fixed-dome gas plant?,This “ring” is a flexible joint between the lower (water –proof) and the upper (gas-proof)part of the hemispherical structure.
"Painting the gas space with water-proofers, latex, or synthetic paints creates a gas-tight layer that prevents gas leaks, which concrete, masonry, and cement rendering alone cannot achieve.","Why is it beneficial to paint the gas space of a fixed-dome plant with materials like water-proofers, latex, or synthetic paints?","The gas space must therefore be painted with a gas –tight layer (e.g. Water –proofer’, Latex or synthetic paints)."
