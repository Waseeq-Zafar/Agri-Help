why are farmers are often advised to spray pesticides in the morning.,"Temperature and humidity: Morning hours typically have cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels, which create favorable conditions for effective pesticide application. Low temperatures reduce the risk of evaporation, allowing the pesticide to stay on the plant surfaces longer. Higher humidity helps the pesticide droplets to spread and adhere to the plant surfaces.

Wind conditions: Generally, wind speeds are lower during the morning hours, reducing the risk of pesticide drift. Calm or gentle breezes help ensure that the pesticide is applied to the target plants without being carried away to non-target areas.

Pest activity: Many pests, such as insects and mites, tend to be more active during the early morning hours. By spraying at this time, the pesticide can directly target and control the pests while they are actively feeding or moving.

Preservation of beneficial insects: Spraying in the morning allows beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies, to forage on flowers and perform pollination activities during the day. Since these insects are crucial for crop pollination and ecological balance, it is important to minimize their exposure to pesticides. Spraying in the morning allows the pesticide residues to degrade or dry off before the peak activity of beneficial insects."

Some farmers harvest mature maize when it is not yet fully dried won't this have some side effects,"Harvesting maize before it is fully dried can have some negative effects on the quality and storability of the grain. Maize should ideally be harvested when the kernels are mature and fully dried, which is indicated by a hard, glossy appearance of the kernels, and a moisture content of around 13-15%."
Is there difference between fresh and dry maize in  terms of the food value.,"Yes, there are differences between fresh and dry maize in terms of their food value. Fresh maize, also known as sweet corn, is harvested when the kernels are still tender and contain a high amount of sugar. Dry maize, on the other hand, is left on the stalks to dry and mature, resulting in hard, starchy kernels."

how doses cover crops reduce soil loss?,"by improving soil structure and increasing infiltration, protecting the soil surface, scattering raindrop energy and reducing the velocity of the movement of water over the soil surface"
Which type of seed is resistant to pests and diseases,"Hybrid seeds: Hybrid seeds are produced by cross-breeding two or more distinct plant varieties to create a new variety with desirable traits, such as disease and pest resistance.

Genetically modified (GM) seeds: GM seeds have been genetically altered to express certain traits, such as resistance to specific pests or diseases. For example, Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) maize has been genetically modified to produce a protein toxic to certain insect pests.

Heirloom or heritage seeds: Heirloom or heritage seeds are non-hybrid seeds that have been passed down from generation to generation, often for centuries. These seeds have developed natural resistance to local pests and diseases over time.

Open-pollinated seeds: Open-pollinated seeds are non-hybrid seeds that have been pollinated by natural means, such as wind or insects. These seeds can be genetically diverse and may exhibit natural resistance to pests and diseases."

What is the appropriate distance for planting beans,"The appropriate distance for planting beans can vary depending on several factors such as the bean variety, soil fertility, and available resources. However, as a general guideline, bush beans are typically planted with a spacing of 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) between plants and 18-24 inches (45-60 cm) between rows. This spacing allows the plants to have enough room for proper growth, airflow, and access to sunlight. For pole beans, which require support, you can plant them in rows spaced about 3 feet (90 cm) apart, with the plants spaced 6-8 inches (15-20 cm) apart within the rows."
Is it criminal if i kill monkeys spoiling my crops,"I am not a legal expert, but the legality of killing monkeys or any wildlife species largely depends on the laws and regulations of your country or region. In many places, wildlife is protected by law, and killing or harming them without proper authorization can be illegal and subject to penalties.

If monkeys or other animals are causing damage to your crops, it is generally recommended to explore non-lethal methods of managing wildlife, such as implementing deterrents, using fencing or netting, or seeking assistance from local wildlife authorities or conservation organizations. They may be able to provide guidance and solutions for addressing wildlife conflicts in a legal and humane manner.
