How can you identify Red-rust in mango trees?,"Red-rust in mango trees can be identified by observing rusty spots on leaves, initially appearing as circular, slightly elevated spots that coalesce to form irregular spots. The mature spores fall off and leave a cream to white velvet texture on the surface of the leaves."
