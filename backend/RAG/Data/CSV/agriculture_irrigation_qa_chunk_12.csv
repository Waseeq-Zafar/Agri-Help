Timely tillage is critical for effective soil management and optimal crop growth.",What are the adverse effects of delayed tillage in poorly leveled fields?,The excess moisture availability in low lying areas delays tillage and other soil manipulation operations.
"Uniform land leveling facilitates even irrigation water distribution, ensuring that water reaches all parts of the field effectively. This reduces water wastage and enhances water use efficiency, leading to better crop hydration, healthier growth, and potentially higher yields. Proper leveling optimizes irrigation practices.",How does uniform land leveling benefit irrigation water distribution?,The total depth of water applied per irrigation is greatly influenced by the quality of land levelling.
