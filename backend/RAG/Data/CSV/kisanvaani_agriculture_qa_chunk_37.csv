How can a farmer control bean weevil in the store?,"Cleaning and hygiene: Before storing beans, ensure that the storage area is clean and free from debris and residues that may harbor pests. Thoroughly clean the storage containers or structures to remove any existing infestations.

Proper storage containers: Use airtight containers, such as metal or plastic bins with tight-fitting lids, to store beans. This helps prevent weevils from entering and infesting the beans. Avoid using jute bags or other porous materials that can allow pest entry.

Temperature control: Weevils thrive in warm temperatures. Keeping the storage area cool can help deter their growth and reproduction. Maintain a temperature below 15 degrees Celsius if possible.

Moisture control: Weevils require moisture to survive and reproduce. Ensure that the beans are properly dried before storage to reduce moisture content. Use moisture-absorbing substances like silica gel packets or dry ash in the storage containers to keep the environment dry.

Natural repellents: Some natural substances act as repellents to weevils. These include dried neem leaves, mint leaves, or tobacco leaves. Place small sachets of these repellents in the storage containers to deter weevils.

Freezing or heating: If feasible, beans can be subjected to extreme temperatures to eliminate weevils. Freezing the beans for a few days at temperatures below -18 degrees Celsius or heating them at temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius can kill the pests.

Regular monitoring: Regularly inspect the stored beans for signs of weevil infestation, such as holes in the beans or presence of adult weevils. If infestation is detected, separate and discard the infested beans to prevent further spread."
