Farmers always ask for the reason why nitrogenous fertilizer are only top dress,"Nitrogen uptake timing: Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and is necessary for various physiological processes, including leaf and stem development. However, nitrogen is a highly mobile nutrient in the soil and can easily leach or wash away if applied too early in the growing season. Therefore, to ensure that the plants have an adequate and readily available nitrogen supply during their active growth phase, nitrogenous fertilizers are often applied as top dressing when the plants are well-established.

Crop demand for nitrogen: Many crops, including maize, have a high demand for nitrogen during their vegetative growth stage. By applying nitrogenous fertilizers as top dressing during this period, it helps meet the crop's nutrient requirements when they need it the most. This timing allows for optimal nitrogen utilization by the plants and promotes vigorous vegetative growth.

Minimizing nitrogen losses: By applying nitrogenous fertilizers as top dressing, farmers can better manage and minimize nitrogen losses from leaching or volatilization. Top dressing allows for a more targeted application directly to the root zone, reducing the risk of nutrient runoff or wastage. It also ensures that the nitrogen remains available to the plants when they require it, improving nutrient efficiency and minimizing environmental impacts."

"what are some potential advantages of intercropping maize with groundnuts:
","Nutrient complementarity: Maize and groundnuts have different nutrient requirements, and by intercropping them, you can maximize the use of available nutrients in the soil. Groundnuts fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil with this essential nutrient, which can benefit the maize crop.

Pest and disease management: Intercropping can help reduce pest and disease pressure. For example, maize can act as a ""trap crop"" for certain pests, diverting them away from groundnuts. Additionally, groundnuts release certain compounds into the soil that can suppress certain soil-borne diseases, benefiting both crops.

Efficient land use: Intercropping allows for the efficient use of limited land resources, as you can cultivate two different crops in the same area. This can be especially beneficial for small-scale farmers with limited land availability."
