Nase 3 and Nase 9 are mid-late maturing varieties, taking around 12-15 months to mature.

Yield potential: Nase 14 is known for its high yield potential, producing a good amount of cassava roots per unit area. Nase 3 and Nase 9 also have decent yield potential but may be slightly lower compared to Nase 14.

I planted maize the past season and had used cow dung while sowing the drought  affected the maize i intend to plant maize again in the same place do i need to apply cow dung again or i plant with out.,"If you intend to plant maize again in the same place where you had previously used cow dung and experienced drought, you can still apply cow dung to the soil to improve its fertility. Cow dung is a good source of organic matter and nutrients that can improve soil health and provide the necessary nutrients for plant growth.

However, if you had applied a large amount of cow dung in the previous season and the soil is still rich in organic matter, you may not need to apply more cow dung. Over-application of organic matter can lead to nutrient imbalances and other soil problems. Therefore, it is important to consider the current nutrient status of the soil before adding more organic matter."

These whiteflies can then spread the virus to the cassava plants, leading to infection and the development of mosaic symptoms."
