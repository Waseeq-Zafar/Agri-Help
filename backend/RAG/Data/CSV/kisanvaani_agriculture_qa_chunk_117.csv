These microorganisms break down the organic matter in the manure, releasing nutrients and byproducts that contribute to the formation of soil aggregates. Microbial activity also produces substances that help bind soil particles together and enhance soil stability."
why are farmers are often advised to spray pesticides in the morning.,"Temperature and humidity: Morning hours typically have cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels, which create favorable conditions for effective pesticide application. Low temperatures reduce the risk of evaporation, allowing the pesticide to stay on the plant surfaces longer. Higher humidity helps the pesticide droplets to spread and adhere to the plant surfaces.

Wind conditions: Generally, wind speeds are lower during the morning hours, reducing the risk of pesticide drift. Calm or gentle breezes help ensure that the pesticide is applied to the target plants without being carried away to non-target areas.

Pest activity: Many pests, such as insects and mites, tend to be more active during the early morning hours. By spraying at this time, the pesticide can directly target and control the pests while they are actively feeding or moving.

Preservation of beneficial insects: Spraying in the morning allows beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies, to forage on flowers and perform pollination activities during the day. Since these insects are crucial for crop pollination and ecological balance, it is important to minimize their exposure to pesticides. Spraying in the morning allows the pesticide residues to degrade or dry off before the peak activity of beneficial insects."
name any other way of storing cassava.,Use proper containers
what is soil fertility,Soil fertility is the ability of soil to sustain plant growth and optimize crop yield
how does water regulates temperature of the soil.,"Water helps to regulate soil temperature, which can affect plant growth and development.

This can help to moderate soil temperature and prevent heat stress in plants."
what are some of the tips on how to best use PICS bags for storing maize grains.,"Clean and dry the grains: Before storing maize grains in PICS bags, make sure that they are thoroughly cleaned and dried to a moisture content of around 12-13%. This will help prevent mold and insect growth.

Fill the bags completely: Fill the PICS bags completely with the maize grains, leaving no empty space. This will help prevent the buildup of oxygen and moisture, which can lead to spoilage and insect growth.

Seal the bags tightly: After filling the bags with maize grains, seal them tightly using the PICS bag sealer or a heat sealer. Make sure that there are no holes or leaks in the bags, as this can allow air and moisture to enter.

Store the bags in a cool and dry place: Store the PICS bags in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight and sources of moisture. A well-ventilated room or a grain storage facility is ideal for storing PICS bags.

Check the bags regularly: Check the PICS bags regularly for any signs of damage, such as holes or leaks, and for any signs of insect or mold growth. If any damage or signs of infestation are found, take immediate action to prevent further damage."
what is the ideal storage temperature for beans?, between 10-15�C
How can a farmer control bean weevil in the store?,"Cleaning and hygiene: Before storing beans, ensure that the storage area is clean and free from debris and residues that may harbor pests. Thoroughly clean the storage containers or structures to remove any existing infestations.

Proper storage containers: Use airtight containers, such as metal or plastic bins with tight-fitting lids, to store beans. This helps prevent weevils from entering and infesting the beans. Avoid using jute bags or other porous materials that can allow pest entry.

Temperature control: Weevils thrive in warm temperatures. Keeping the storage area cool can help deter their growth and reproduction. Maintain a temperature below 15 degrees Celsius if possible.

Moisture control: Weevils require moisture to survive and reproduce. Ensure that the beans are properly dried before storage to reduce moisture content. Use moisture-absorbing substances like silica gel packets or dry ash in the storage containers to keep the environment dry.

Natural repellents: Some natural substances act as repellents to weevils. These include dried neem leaves, mint leaves, or tobacco leaves. Place small sachets of these repellents in the storage containers to deter weevils.

Freezing or heating: If feasible, beans can be subjected to extreme temperatures to eliminate weevils. Freezing the beans for a few days at temperatures below -18 degrees Celsius or heating them at temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius can kill the pests.

Regular monitoring: Regularly inspect the stored beans for signs of weevil infestation, such as holes in the beans or presence of adult weevils. If infestation is detected, separate and discard the infested beans to prevent further spread."

 can delaying weeding cassava cause cassava mosaic,"Delaying weeding in cassava fields can create favorable conditions for the spread of Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD). Weeds can act as alternative hosts for the whiteflies that transmit the virus responsible for CMD. When weeds are left to grow and multiply in the cassava field, they can attract whiteflies and serve as a reservoir for the virus. These whiteflies can then spread the virus to the cassava plants, leading to infection and the development of mosaic symptoms."
