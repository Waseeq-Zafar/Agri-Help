name the steps the farmer can use to control pest after detection the garden.,"Identify the disease: Try to identify the specific disease affecting the cassava plants. Observe the symptoms, such as leaf discoloration, wilting, lesions, or any other unusual signs. You can consult local agricultural extension services, agricultural experts, or plant pathologists to help identify the disease accurately.

Isolate and remove infected plants: If the disease is confirmed, promptly isolate and remove the infected plants from the field. This prevents further spread of the disease to healthy plants. Properly dispose of the infected plants by burning, burying, or removing them from the field.

Sanitize tools and equipment: Clean and sanitize any tools, equipment, or machinery that have come into contact with the infected plants. This helps prevent the disease from spreading to other fields or areas.

Implement cultural practices: Adopt cultural practices that can help manage or control the disease. These may include adjusting planting density, optimizing nutrition and irrigation practices, and practicing crop rotation. Some diseases may be controlled by removing alternate host plants or weeds that can serve as reservoirs for the pathogens.

Seek expert advice: Consult local agricultural extension services, agricultural experts, or plant pathologists for specific recommendations on disease management strategies. They can provide guidance on appropriate fungicides or other control measures if necessary.

Monitor and scout regularly: Continuously monitor the field to track the spread and severity of the disease. Regular scouting helps identify any new infections and allows for timely intervention."
