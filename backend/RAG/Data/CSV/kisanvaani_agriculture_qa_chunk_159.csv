I planted maize the past season and had used cow dung while sowing the drought  affected the maize i intend to plant maize again in the same place do i need to apply cow dung again or i plant with out.,"If you intend to plant maize again in the same place where you had previously used cow dung and experienced drought, you can still apply cow dung to the soil to improve its fertility. Cow dung is a good source of organic matter and nutrients that can improve soil health and provide the necessary nutrients for plant growth.

However, if you had applied a large amount of cow dung in the previous season and the soil is still rich in organic matter, you may not need to apply more cow dung. Over-application of organic matter can lead to nutrient imbalances and other soil problems. Therefore, it is important to consider the current nutrient status of the soil before adding more organic matter."

Is it criminal if i kill monkeys spoiling my crops,"I am not a legal expert, but the legality of killing monkeys or any wildlife species largely depends on the laws and regulations of your country or region. In many places, wildlife is protected by law, and killing or harming them without proper authorization can be illegal and subject to penalties.

If monkeys or other animals are causing damage to your crops, it is generally recommended to explore non-lethal methods of managing wildlife, such as implementing deterrents, using fencing or netting, or seeking assistance from local wildlife authorities or conservation organizations. They may be able to provide guidance and solutions for addressing wildlife conflicts in a legal and humane manner.
