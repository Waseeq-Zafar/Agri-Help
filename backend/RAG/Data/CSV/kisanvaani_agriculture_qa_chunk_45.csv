Can beans still be planted in October this year in amolatar?,"In Amolatar, which is located in Northern Uganda, October is generally considered the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the dry season. However, with the changing climate, it is difficult to predict weather patterns accurately. It is possible to plant beans in October if there is still enough soil moisture, either from the remaining rains or from irrigation. "
"I was told that for quickly germination of maize seeds, it needs first to be shocked in water before planting, is that true?","No, it is not necessary to shock maize seeds in water before planting for quicker germination.
