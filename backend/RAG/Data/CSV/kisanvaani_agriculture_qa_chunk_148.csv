Replication and spread: Once the virus has infected the plant, it replicates and spreads within the plant, causing damage to the leaves, stem, and grains of the plant.

Transmission to new plants: The virus can be transmitted to new plants when an infected leafhopper feeds on a healthy plant. The virus can also be spread through infected seeds or plant debris.
