Explain how agronomic practices can be used to impact on the extent of damage done by crop pests? ,"Crop rotation: Rotating crops helps disrupt the life cycles of pests and reduces the buildup of pest populations. By alternating different crops in the same field, pests that are specific to a particular crop are less likely to persist and cause significant damage.

Proper planting time and spacing: Planting crops at the appropriate time and with the correct spacing can promote healthy plant growth and vigor. Well-spaced plants have better air circulation, reducing the favorable conditions for pests and diseases to spread. Timely planting can also help avoid critical pest infestation periods.

Field sanitation: Proper field sanitation involves removing crop residues, weeds, and other debris from the field. These residues can harbor pests and diseases, providing a breeding ground for future infestations. Removing crop debris and maintaining clean field conditions can help reduce pest populations.

Use of resistant or tolerant varieties: Planting crop varieties that have natural resistance or tolerance to specific pests can greatly reduce pest damage. Resistant varieties have built-in genetic traits that make them less susceptible to pest attacks. By choosing and planting resistant or tolerant varieties, farmers can minimize the impact of pests on their crops."
