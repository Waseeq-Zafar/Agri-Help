Organic farming seeks to build and conserve soil fertility by balancing what is removed from and returned to the soil. This approach ensures long-term soil health and productivity.,What is the relationship between organic farming and soil fertility?,Organic farming must aim to build and conserve a bank of soil fertility. The balance of fertility will be dependent on what is removed from the soil and what is returned.
"Soil nutrient loss in organic farming is mainly due to crop removal, leaching through or over soil surfaces, and evaporation into the atmosphere, reducing the soil’s nutrient content.",Describe the primary causes of soil nutrient loss in organic farming.,"Losses from the soil arise as a consequence of crop removal from the field, combined with leaching either through soil or across soil surfaces or through evaporation into the atmosphere."
"Compost, rich in organic matter, serves as an excellent food source for soil microorganisms. Their activity and this organic input transform soil organic matter (SOM) into humus, boosting soil fertility.",How does compost contribute to soil fertility in organic farming?,"Organic matter, particularly in the form of compost, provides an ideal food source for soil microorganisms. It is the action of these organisms and the feeding of the soil with appropriate organic matter that generates Soil organic matter (SOM) to humus."
"SOM is crucial in organic farming, providing a nutrient-rich substrate for soil biology. It enhances soil structure, facilitates nutrient availability, and supports biological activity, essential for a healthy soil ecosystem.",Discuss the role of soil organic matter (SOM) in soil structure and nutrient availability.,"Managing SOM is extremely important in organic farming. SOM provides a substrate and vital food source for biological activity, as well as being a major source of nutrients and playing a vital role in soil structure."
"SOM improves soil's water retention and drainage capabilities and enhances soil aeration. Additionally, it regulates the soil's cation exchange capacity (CEC), crucial for maintaining nutrient balance and soil structure.",How does soil organic matter (SOM) affect soil water retention and aeration?,"SOM plays an important role in soil water retention and drainage, as well as soil aeration. It also has an important role in regulating the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soils."
"Soil microorganisms decompose organic matter, breaking it down into simpler compounds. This process, aided by feeding the soil with suitable organic material, transforms soil organic matter (SOM) into humus, a vital component of fertile soil.",Explain how soil microorganisms contribute to the formation of humus.,It is the action of these organisms and the feeding of the soil with appropriate organic matter that generates Soil organic matter (SOM) to humus.
"Humus enhances soil's cation exchange capacity (CEC) by adsorbing and regulating essential cations like calcium and magnesium. It also aids in the regulation of pesticides and heavy metals, contributing to a balanced soil ecosystem.",How does humus affect the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soils?,"Humus can adsorb and help regulate cations, such as Ca and Mg, as well as pesticides and heavy metals."
"Organic farming must manage inputs and outputs to maintain soil fertility. This involves building and conserving a fertility bank, ensuring nutrients removed by crops are replenished, and enhancing soil health through balanced input of organic materials.",Outline the elements that organic farming must manage to maintain soil fertility.,Organic farming must aim to build and conserve a bank of soil fertility. The balance of fertility will be dependent on what is removed from the soil and what is returned.
Nitrogen is a vital part of proteins and chlorophyll in plants. Insufficient nitrogen can cause early maturity and reduced yield in crops.,What role does nitrogen play in plants?,Vital part of proteins and chlorophyll; too little causes early maturity and reduced yield
