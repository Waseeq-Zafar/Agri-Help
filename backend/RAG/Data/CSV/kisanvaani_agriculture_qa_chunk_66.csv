How can i know that soil lacks air as a major nutrient,"To determine whether soil lacks air, you can perform a simple test called the squeeze test. Take a handful of soil and squeeze it tightly in your hand. If the soil remains in a tight ball and does not crumble, it may indicate that the soil is too compacted and lacks adequate air. Another indicator of soil lacking air is the presence of waterlogged areas or standing water after rain or irrigation."
