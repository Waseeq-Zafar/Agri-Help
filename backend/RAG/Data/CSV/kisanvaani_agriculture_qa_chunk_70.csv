How can a farmer control bean weevil in the store?,"Cleaning and hygiene: Before storing beans, ensure that the storage area is clean and free from debris and residues that may harbor pests. Thoroughly clean the storage containers or structures to remove any existing infestations.

Proper storage containers: Use airtight containers, such as metal or plastic bins with tight-fitting lids, to store beans. This helps prevent weevils from entering and infesting the beans. Avoid using jute bags or other porous materials that can allow pest entry.

Temperature control: Weevils thrive in warm temperatures. Keeping the storage area cool can help deter their growth and reproduction. Maintain a temperature below 15 degrees Celsius if possible.

Moisture control: Weevils require moisture to survive and reproduce. Ensure that the beans are properly dried before storage to reduce moisture content. Use moisture-absorbing substances like silica gel packets or dry ash in the storage containers to keep the environment dry.

Natural repellents: Some natural substances act as repellents to weevils. These include dried neem leaves, mint leaves, or tobacco leaves. Place small sachets of these repellents in the storage containers to deter weevils.

Freezing or heating: If feasible, beans can be subjected to extreme temperatures to eliminate weevils. Freezing the beans for a few days at temperatures below -18 degrees Celsius or heating them at temperatures above 60 degrees Celsius can kill the pests.

Regular monitoring: Regularly inspect the stored beans for signs of weevil infestation, such as holes in the beans or presence of adult weevils. If infestation is detected, separate and discard the infested beans to prevent further spread."

why do cassava plants may shed their leaves during dry season.,"Water stress: Cassava plants have a deep root system that helps them access water from deeper soil layers. However, during prolonged dry periods, the availability of water may become limited, leading to water stress in the plants. As a survival mechanism, cassava plants shed their leaves to reduce water loss through transpiration and conserve moisture.

Nutrient deficiency: Inadequate nutrient availability, particularly nitrogen, can cause cassava plants to shed their leaves. During the dry season, nutrient uptake by the plants may be hampered, leading to nutrient deficiencies and subsequent leaf drop.

Pests and diseases: Dry conditions can increase the vulnerability of cassava plants to pests and diseases. Insect infestations, such as cassava green mites or cassava mealybugs, and diseases like cassava mosaic disease or cassava bacterial blight, can cause leaf damage and subsequent leaf shedding.

Natural plant response: In some cases, leaf shedding during the dry season may be a natural response of cassava plants to conserve energy and focus resources on survival. By shedding leaves, the plant can reduce its overall water and nutrient requirements and redirect resources to essential parts such as the stem and tuberous roots."
