Ensuring these are securely fastened can prevent leaks.",What joint components might be improperly fixed causing leaks in sprinkler systems?,"The clamp and latches, saddles nut and bolt are not properly fixed."
"If a sprinkler is not operating properly, check the spring tension, rubber and Teflon gaskets, swing arm alignment, and pivot pin to identify any issues preventing proper operation.",What should be checked if a sprinkler is not operating properly?,"Sprinkler is not operating properly:
● Check spring tension, check rubber and Teflon gaskets, check swing arm alignment, check pivot pin etc."
"High water pressure, greater than 2.5 kg/cm², benefits the sprinkler irrigation system by ensuring effective water distribution and allowing the system to cover a larger area uniformly. This pressure helps in overcoming environmental barriers such as wind and land elevation variations, promoting consistent irrigation.",How does high water pressure benefit the sprinkler irrigation system?,High water pressure required in sprinkler (>2.5 kg / cm2)
"Clean water is crucial for the efficiency of sprinkler systems because impurities like sand, debris, and large amounts of dissolved salts can clog or damage the system's components. This could lead to reduced water flow, uneven distribution, and potential system breakdown, necessitating additional maintenance and operational costs.",Discuss the importance of clean water for the efficiency of sprinkler systems.,The water must be clean and free of sand debris and large amounts of dissolves salts.
"Sprinkler irrigation systems often require a significant initial investment due to the cost of purchasing and installing equipment, such as pumps, pipes, and sprinklers. The high power consumption is due to the need to maintain sufficient water pressure, which necessitates the use of powerful pumps and consistent electrical supply, adding to operational costs.",Why might sprinkler irrigation systems require significant initial investment and high power consumption?,The sprinkler method usually requires the highest initial investment. Power requirement is usually high.
