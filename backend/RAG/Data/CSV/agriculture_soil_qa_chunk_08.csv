To prevent erosion and nitrate leaching,Why should periods of bare ground between cash crops be minimized?,"Maintaining cover: Periods of bare ground between cash crops should be kept to a minimum, as bare soils are very vulnerable to erosion by wind and rain, as well as nitrate leaching."
Nitrogen demanding cash crops,Which crops can benefit from the residual nitrogen released by incorporated leys?,"Cash crops: Nitrogen demanding cash crops, such as wheat, potatoes or cabbages, are usually grown immediately after the ley in order to maximise utilisation of the large amount of nitrogen released in the season after incorporation."
Undersowing cereals,What agricultural practice can minimize the ground cover loss?,"Cultivations: Undersowing cereals with a new ley is a good way of establishing cover before harvest, preventing a period of bare soil."
Damages soil structure,How does cultivating soil in wet conditions affect it?,"Cultivations: Cultivating in wet soil conditions, such as sowing spring cereals in a wet spring, can damage soil structure to such an extent that it may take several years to remedy."

P and K inputs are often made to the ley phase of the rotation and then released into plant-available form as the ley is ploughed out into the following arable phase.
Difficulties and high costs in manure transport.,What can result in the loss of nutrients from outlying farm parts?,"The return of nutrients to the laying phase from the slurry is often hindered by the difficulties and high costs involved in transporting manure from the dairy unit because it is easy.
