Legumes help improve soil fertility and are a great source of organic nitrogen.,What is the benefit of legumes for soil fertility mentioned?,"The benefit of legumes for soil fertility has been known for centuries. White clover has been part of the Norfolk four course rotation, and other legumes since the 17th century, and cover crops have been an integral farming tool."
Soluble (plant-available) and organic,What are the two forms of nitrogen present in fresh manures?,Nitrogen is present in fresh manures in both soluble (plant-available) and more stable organic forms.
Rhizobia,What type of bacteria is essential for the nitrogen fixation process in legumes?,"Legumes root module is like a miniature biological factory: it contains large numbers of root nodule bacteria, known as Rhizobia."
Nitrogen fixation is the process of converting atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia by Rhizobia bacteria in legumes.,What is nitrogen fixation?,"The legume root nodule is like a miniature biological factory: it contains large numbers of root nodule bacteria, known as Rhizobia. Rhizobia produce an enzyme which helps in the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia."
"It is influenced by soil microbial status and temperature, and composts release nutrients slowly.",Why is the timing of compost application crucial?,"However, nutrient release from compost will be gradual and is substantially influenced by the microbial status of the soil and soil temperature. Composts do not have a significant direct effect on K or P availability."
Run-off and leaching,What leads to the loss of nitrogen in the soil?,"The soluble forms, nitrate and ammonium, can be lost in run-off and leaching."
"It depends on the type and diet of livestock, bedding used, and the manure production system.",How does the amount of organic matter and nutrients in manure depend on livestock?,"The amount of organic matter and nutrients in manure will depend on livestock type and diet, bedding used and the manure production system (solid or slurry)."

Slowly available nutrients minimize nitrogen loss and provide a steady release of nutrients.,Why are slowly available nutrients in compost more beneficial?,"Composts are stable products formed from manures and other organic materials, where nitrogen is converted into more stable forms. Therefore, it is not as a good a source of instant nitrogen as fresh manure but releases nutrients slowly."
The amount of material applied influences nutrient availability.,What dictates the availability of nutrients from compost?,"All of the nutrients in farmyard manure become available in the year of application, about 80 per cent of K is available but only about one quarter of the N becomes available in this period."
Reduces the loss of nitrogen as ammonia,What is the advantage of rapidly incorporating manure into arable crops?,Rapid incorporation after application decreases the loss of nitrogen as ammonia.
"Legumes, with the help of Rhizobia bacteria, fix nitrogen from the atmosphere into their root nodules.",How is the nitrogen fixation process initiated in legume crops?,There are three different types of legume root nodule ‘fixers’… Fixers are legumes that fix nitrogen from the atmosphere into their root nodules.
About one quarter,What percentage of nitrogen (N) becomes available in the first year of manure application?,"All of the nutrients in farmyard manure become available in the year of application, about 80 per cent of K is available but only about one quarter of the N becomes available in this period."
It does not significantly affect K or P availability. Amount of material applied is more crucial.,What is the important aspect of composting in relation to nutrient release?,Composting does not have a significant direct effect on K or P availability. The availability is more related to the amount of material applied than to whether it is applied in the form of manure or compost.
Quick incorporation after application,What is the recommended practice for applying manure to arable crops?,Arable crops. Rapid incorporation after application decreases the loss of nitrogen as ammonia.
Delayed applications can lead to increased nitrogen utilization by crops.,What is the risk involved in delaying applications of manure?,Delaying applications (in particular those with a high proportion of readily available N) until late winter or spring will increase N utilisation by the crop.
