"Compost is environmentally beneficial because fewer nutrients are lost to the environment, retaining more for subsequent crop use, and reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers.",Why is compost environmentally beneficial?,"5.1  Compost Apart from being environmentally beneficial, this also means that more nutrients are retained in the soil for use by subsequent crops."
"In an effective composting process, pests, pathogens, weeds, and toxins present in fresh or stacked manure are destroyed.",What happens to pests and pathogens in an effective composting process?,"5.1  Compost Furthermore, an effective composting process will destroy pests, pathogens, weeds and weed seeds, and toxins that may be present in fresh or stacked manure."
"Compost benefits the soil more than slurry because its stable form reduces nutrient losses through run-off or leaching, ensuring more nutrients are retained in the soil.",How does compost benefit the soil compared to slurry?,"5.1  Compost The stability of the final compost means that losses through run off or leaching are much lower when compared with equivalent applications of fresh manure or slurry, which have a greater proportion of readily soluble nutrients."
"Good compost is produced through the microbial decomposition of organic matter in an aerobic environment, resulting in humus. The key characteristics of the final product include being stable, slowly degradable, and providing a long-term source of stabilized soil nutrients. This contributes significantly to soil health and plant growth.",Describe how good compost is produced and its key final characteristics.,"5.1  Compost Good compost is a source of stabilised nutrients generated through the microbial decomposition of organic matter in an aerobic environment to produce humus. The final product of an effective aerobic composting process is a stable and slowly degradable material, which provides a long-term source of soil nutrients."
"Compost has higher nutrient retention compared to fresh manure because it is more stable, reducing nutrient loss through runoff or leaching. Fresh manure and slurry contain more readily soluble nutrients, leading to higher losses. This makes compost a more efficient and environmentally friendly option for nutrient management in soils.",Compare the nutrient retention in compost with that in fresh manure.,"5.1  Compost The stability of the final compost means that losses through run off or leaching are much lower when compared with equivalent applications of fresh manure or slurry, which have a greater proportion of readily soluble nutrients."
An aerobic environment is crucial for the composting process as it facilitates the microbial decomposition of organic matter into humus. This environment ensures the resulting compost is rich in stabilized nutrients and promotes the formation of a stable and slowly degradable material. The process thereby produces compost that is both beneficial for soil health and environmentally sustainable.,Explain how the aerobic environment impacts the composting process and its final product.,5.1  Compost Good compost is a source of stabilised nutrients generated through the microbial decomposition of organic matter in an aerobic environment to produce humus.
"Using compost over synthetic fertilizers offers several environmental benefits: it reduces nutrient runoff and leaching, enhances soil structure and fertility through stabilized organic matter, and minimizes chemical inputs. Compost also enriches soil with beneficial microorganisms and organic content, promoting sustainable agriculture and reducing the dependency on non-renewable resources.",Discuss the environmental benefits of using compost over synthetic fertilizers.,"5.1  Compost Apart from being environmentally beneficial, this also means that more nutrients are retained in the soil for use by subsequent crops."
