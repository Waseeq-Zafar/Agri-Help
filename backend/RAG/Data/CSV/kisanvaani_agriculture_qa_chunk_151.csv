name the steps the farmer can use to control pest after detection the garden.,"Identify the disease: Try to identify the specific disease affecting the cassava plants. Observe the symptoms, such as leaf discoloration, wilting, lesions, or any other unusual signs. You can consult local agricultural extension services, agricultural experts, or plant pathologists to help identify the disease accurately.

Isolate and remove infected plants: If the disease is confirmed, promptly isolate and remove the infected plants from the field. This prevents further spread of the disease to healthy plants. Properly dispose of the infected plants by burning, burying, or removing them from the field.

Sanitize tools and equipment: Clean and sanitize any tools, equipment, or machinery that have come into contact with the infected plants. This helps prevent the disease from spreading to other fields or areas.

Implement cultural practices: Adopt cultural practices that can help manage or control the disease. These may include adjusting planting density, optimizing nutrition and irrigation practices, and practicing crop rotation. Some diseases may be controlled by removing alternate host plants or weeds that can serve as reservoirs for the pathogens.

Seek expert advice: Consult local agricultural extension services, agricultural experts, or plant pathologists for specific recommendations on disease management strategies. They can provide guidance on appropriate fungicides or other control measures if necessary.

Monitor and scout regularly: Continuously monitor the field to track the spread and severity of the disease. Regular scouting helps identify any new infections and allows for timely intervention."
Where can we get fertilizer on low price for maize?,"Agricultural input suppliers: Visit local agricultural input suppliers or agro-dealers in your area.

Farmer cooperatives: Joining a farmer cooperative or collective can provide access to bulk purchasing and discounted prices on agricultural inputs, including fertilizers. Cooperative members often benefit from collective bargaining power and can negotiate better prices with suppliers.

Government subsidies or programs: In some countries, governments may offer subsidies or support programs for agricultural inputs, including fertilizers. Check with local agricultural extension services or government agricultural agencies to see if there are any such programs available in your area.

Local composting or organic waste initiatives: If you are interested in organic fertilizers, consider exploring local composting initiatives or organic waste management programs.

"what are difference between Nase 14, Nase 3, and Nase 9 are different varieties of cassava.","Maturity period: Nase 14 is an early-maturing variety, typically reaching maturity in about 9-12 months after planting. Nase 3 and Nase 9 are mid-late maturing varieties, taking around 12-15 months to mature.

Yield potential: Nase 14 is known for its high yield potential, producing a good amount of cassava roots per unit area. Nase 3 and Nase 9 also have decent yield potential but may be slightly lower compared to Nase 14.

Pest and disease resistance: Nase 14 has shown good resistance to major pests and diseases that affect cassava, such as cassava mosaic disease and cassava bacterial blight. Nase 3 and Nase 9 also exhibit some level of resistance but may be relatively less resistant compared to Nase 14.

Root quality: The root qualities of these varieties may vary. Nase 14 is known for its relatively higher starch content, which is desirable for certain cassava-based products. Nase 3 and Nase 9 may have similar or slightly lower starch content but can still provide good quality roots.

Which type of seed is resistant to pests and diseases,"Hybrid seeds: Hybrid seeds are produced by cross-breeding two or more distinct plant varieties to create a new variety with desirable traits, such as disease and pest resistance.

Genetically modified (GM) seeds: GM seeds have been genetically altered to express certain traits, such as resistance to specific pests or diseases. For example, Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) maize has been genetically modified to produce a protein toxic to certain insect pests.

Heirloom or heritage seeds: Heirloom or heritage seeds are non-hybrid seeds that have been passed down from generation to generation, often for centuries. These seeds have developed natural resistance to local pests and diseases over time.

Open-pollinated seeds: Open-pollinated seeds are non-hybrid seeds that have been pollinated by natural means, such as wind or insects. These seeds can be genetically diverse and may exhibit natural resistance to pests and diseases."

name two commonly used nitrogen-based fertilizers that can be applied 4-6 weeks after germination.,"Urea: Urea is a widely used nitrogen fertilizer that contains a high concentration of nitrogen. It is typically applied in granular form and can be broadcasted or applied as a side-dressing around the base of the plants. Urea is readily available to plants and helps promote vigorous growth and greening.

Ammonium Nitrate: Ammonium nitrate is another nitrogen-based fertilizer that provides a quick-release source of nitrogen. It is commonly used for top-dressing or side-dressing application in the early stages of crop growth. Ammonium nitrate delivers nitrogen rapidly to the plants, stimulating growth and improving overall plant health."
