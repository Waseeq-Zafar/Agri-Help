why do cassava plants may shed their leaves during dry season.,"Water stress: Cassava plants have a deep root system that helps them access water from deeper soil layers. However, during prolonged dry periods, the availability of water may become limited, leading to water stress in the plants. As a survival mechanism, cassava plants shed their leaves to reduce water loss through transpiration and conserve moisture.

Nutrient deficiency: Inadequate nutrient availability, particularly nitrogen, can cause cassava plants to shed their leaves. During the dry season, nutrient uptake by the plants may be hampered, leading to nutrient deficiencies and subsequent leaf drop.

Pests and diseases: Dry conditions can increase the vulnerability of cassava plants to pests and diseases. Insect infestations, such as cassava green mites or cassava mealybugs, and diseases like cassava mosaic disease or cassava bacterial blight, can cause leaf damage and subsequent leaf shedding.

Natural plant response: In some cases, leaf shedding during the dry season may be a natural response of cassava plants to conserve energy and focus resources on survival. By shedding leaves, the plant can reduce its overall water and nutrient requirements and redirect resources to essential parts such as the stem and tuberous roots."

what are some of the tips on how to best use PICS bags for storing maize grains.,"Clean and dry the grains: Before storing maize grains in PICS bags, make sure that they are thoroughly cleaned and dried to a moisture content of around 12-13%. This will help prevent mold and insect growth.

Fill the bags completely: Fill the PICS bags completely with the maize grains, leaving no empty space. This will help prevent the buildup of oxygen and moisture, which can lead to spoilage and insect growth.

Seal the bags tightly: After filling the bags with maize grains, seal them tightly using the PICS bag sealer or a heat sealer. Make sure that there are no holes or leaks in the bags, as this can allow air and moisture to enter.

Store the bags in a cool and dry place: Store the PICS bags in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight and sources of moisture. A well-ventilated room or a grain storage facility is ideal for storing PICS bags.

Check the bags regularly: Check the PICS bags regularly for any signs of damage, such as holes or leaks, and for any signs of insect or mold growth. If any damage or signs of infestation are found, take immediate action to prevent further damage."
