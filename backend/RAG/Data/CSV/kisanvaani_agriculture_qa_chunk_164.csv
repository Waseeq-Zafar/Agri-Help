How can i know that soil lacks air as a major nutrient,"To determine whether soil lacks air, you can perform a simple test called the squeeze test. Take a handful of soil and squeeze it tightly in your hand. If the soil remains in a tight ball and does not crumble, it may indicate that the soil is too compacted and lacks adequate air. Another indicator of soil lacking air is the presence of waterlogged areas or standing water after rain or irrigation."

what several factors need to be considered before deciding the ideal timing for planting.,"Soil Moisture: The first rain should provide enough moisture to support seed germination and early growth. It's important to ensure that the soil has enough moisture content to facilitate seedling emergence and root development.

Temperature: The temperature should be suitable for the specific crop being planted. Some crops have optimal temperature requirements for germination and early growth. If the first rain coincides with extremely cold or hot temperatures, it may negatively affect crop establishment.

Rain Pattern: The first rain should ideally mark the beginning of a consistent rainy season. If the first rain is followed by a prolonged dry spell, it may result in inadequate moisture for crop growth, leading to poor germination and plant survival.

Crop Requirements: Different crops have different preferences regarding moisture and temperature. It's essential to consider the specific requirements of the crop you intend to plant and ensure that the environmental conditions during the first rain align with those requirements.

Field Preparation: Adequate field preparation, including soil tillage and weed control, should be completed before the first rain to optimize planting conditions."
