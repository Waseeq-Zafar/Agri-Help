The access in the field crop is easy which facilitates intercultural operations like manual weeding, spraying of fertilizers, herbicides as well as pesticides. The ridge and furrow system also facilitates good drainage because the soil is above ground level and heavy rains drain off much better. The fertilizer use efficiency is also enhanced and crops come up better in comparison to conventional sowing. Saving of water, fertilizer, seed and other crop inputs make its use more beneficial. In addition, movement of worker engaged in field works becomes easy."
"The primary change is altering crop geometry and land configuration, providing more effective control over irrigation, drainage, nutrient transport, and rainwater management.",What is the primary change when transitioning from flat to ridge-furrow systems for crop planting?,"Change over from growing crops in flat to ridge-furrow system of planting crops on raised bed alters the crop geometry and land configuration, offers more effective control over irrigation and drainage as well as their impacts on transport and transformations of nutrients, and rainwater management during the monsoon season."
"In an FIRB system, water moves horizontally from the furrows into the beds by subbing, pulled upwards by capillarity, evaporation, and transpiration, and downwards by gravity.",How does water move in a furrow irrigated raised bed (FIRB) system?,"In furrow irrigated raised bed (FIRB) system, water moves horizontally from the furrows into the beds (subbing) and is pulled upwards in the bed towards the soil surface by capillarity, evaporation and transpiration, and downwards largely by gravity."
"Key factors include spacing between tractor tyres, soil types, rainfall, groundwater conditions, salinity, irrigation water quality, and crop rotation requirements.",What factors are crucial in determining the dimensions of raised beds?,"In determining the dimensions of the beds, factors such as spacing between tractor tyres, soil types, rainfall and groundwater conditions, salinity and irrigation water quality and requirements of crops grown in rotation are of prime importance."
"Irrigation and fertilizer management, crop residue management, inter-tillage, and weed management are essential for developing a permanent system of bed planting.",What must be considered for developing a permanent system of bed planting?,"For developing a permanent system of bed planting, factors like irrigation and fertilizer management, crop residue management, inter-tillage and weed management must be considered together."
"The ridge-furrow system typically uses dimensions of 67cm width, with a bed top width of 37cm and furrow width of 30cm.",What are the typical dimensions considered appropriate for the ridge-furrow system in IGP?,"For major soil types (sandy loam to loam soils) and crops (inter-row crop spacing requirement) grown in the IGP, ridge-furrow system, of 67cm width (top width of bed-37cm; and of furrow-30cm) is often considered appropriate."
Crops such as rice and wheat can be planted on raised beds in the ridge-furrow system.,What crops can be planted on raised beds in the ridge-furrow system?,"On the raised beds, two rows of rice, wheat."
Capillarity pulls water upwards in the bed towards the soil surface in the FIRB system.,What role does capillarity play in the FIRB system?,and is pulled upwards in the bed towards the soil surface by capillarity
