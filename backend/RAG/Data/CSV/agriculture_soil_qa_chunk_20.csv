This approach helps in capturing the variability and producing a sample that accurately reflects the whole batch.",How can one ensure that a sample is representative in heterogeneous materials?,4.2  Sampling for chemical analysis
"Handling highly volatile substances during sampling involves using tightly sealed containers to prevent evaporation, working in controlled environments to stabilize the substance, and employing rapid sampling methods to minimize exposure time. These techniques help in preserving the integrity of volatile samples for accurate chemical analysis.",What techniques can be used to handle highly volatile substances during sampling for chemical analysis?,4.2  Sampling for chemical analysis
"Sample integrity is crucial for the validity of chemical analysis results. If the sample's composition changes due to contamination, degradation, or improper handling, it no longer represents the original material. Maintaining sample integrity through proper preservation, transportation, and storage ensures that the analysis reflects the true properties of the material.",Discuss the relationship between sample integrity and the validity of chemical analysis results.,4.2  Sampling for chemical analysis
"Best practices for labeling and documentation during sampling include using clear, durable labels with detailed sample information, maintaining comprehensive records of sampling procedures, and ensuring traceability. Accurate documentation supports data integrity, facilitates chain-of-custody tracking, and enhances the reproducibility and reliability of the analytical results.",What are some best practices for labeling and documentation during chemical analysis sampling?,4.2  Sampling for chemical analysis
