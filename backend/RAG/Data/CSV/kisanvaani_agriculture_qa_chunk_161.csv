Is it criminal if i kill monkeys spoiling my crops,"I am not a legal expert, but the legality of killing monkeys or any wildlife species largely depends on the laws and regulations of your country or region. In many places, wildlife is protected by law, and killing or harming them without proper authorization can be illegal and subject to penalties.

If monkeys or other animals are causing damage to your crops, it is generally recommended to explore non-lethal methods of managing wildlife, such as implementing deterrents, using fencing or netting, or seeking assistance from local wildlife authorities or conservation organizations. They may be able to provide guidance and solutions for addressing wildlife conflicts in a legal and humane manner.

list symptoms of maize streak disease.,"Stunted growth: Infected maize plants often exhibit stunted growth compared to healthy plants. The plants may fail to reach their normal height and size.

Chlorotic streaks or stripes: One of the characteristic symptoms of maize streak virus is the appearance of chlorotic streaks or stripes on the leaves. These streaks are usually pale yellow to white in color and run parallel to the leaf veins.

Necrosis or browning: As the infection progresses, the chlorotic streaks may turn necrotic or brown. This necrosis can extend to the entire leaf blade, resulting in a scorched or burnt appearance.

Leaf curling and twisting: Infected maize leaves may exhibit curling and twisting, with a downward or upward curling of the leaf margins. This distortion is more prominent in severe infections.

Reduced grain production: Maize plants infected with maize streak virus often experience a reduction in grain production. Infected plants may have fewer or smaller ears, and the kernels may be poorly developed or discolored.

This improves soil structure, enhances nutrient retention, and promotes microbial activity.

Crop rotation and diversification: Rotate maize with leguminous crops (such as beans, peas, or clover) that fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and improve soil nitrogen levels. Crop rotation also helps break pest and disease cycles and promotes overall soil health.

Green manure cover crops: Plant cover crops like clover, vetch, or hairy vetch during fallow periods. These cover crops add organic matter, prevent soil erosion, and improve soil structure.
