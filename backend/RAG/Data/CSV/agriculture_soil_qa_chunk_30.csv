"Spring incorporation is recommended because it reduces the risk of nitrate leaching. During spring, crop growth is faster and drainage is less problematic, thereby minimizing the amount of nitrate lost from the soil.",Why is spring incorporation recommended for minimizing nitrate leaching during ley incorporation?,"Where possible, spring incorporation prior to spring cropping has been shown to minimise leaching loss at this vulnerable stage of the rotation."
"Delaying ley incorporation until as late as possible reduces nitrate leaching by ensuring that crops can uptake more nitrate, and there's less risk of nitrates being washed away during periods of high drainage.",How does delaying ley incorporation influence nitrate leaching?,Delay ley incorporation as late as possible as lower
"Nitrate leaching near watercourses can lead to serious environmental damage such as water pollution, harming aquatic life by causing eutrophication, and contaminating drinking water sources with excessive nitrate levels, which can have health implications.",What are the environmental concerns associated with nitrate leaching near watercourses?,"This not only reduces the availability of nitrogen for following crops but can also cause serious environmental damage, especially when fields are adjacent to watercourses."
