The fertility building phase contains a high proportion of legumes. The fertility depleting phase normally comprises non-leguminous crops sustained by nitrogen mineralised from the residues of incorporated legumes.
"While legumes enhance nitrogen levels in soil, they cannot add phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). To increase P and K levels, farmers must rely on external nutrient sources. Thus, crop rotations with legumes have limitations in providing a complete nutrient build-up.",What are the limitations of using legumes in crop rotations for nutrient enrichment?,The fertility building phase contains a high proportion of legumes. ‘Fertility building’ is a commonly used term but this is a nitrogen building phase as legumes cannot add P and K to the system. Soil P and K levels can only be increased through bought-in nutrient sources.
"To prevent nutrient loss in organic farming, it's crucial to adopt robust management practices such as appropriate manure application, cover cropping, and monitoring nutrient gains and losses. These practices help maintain soil fertility and enhance crop productivity.",What essential management practices are recommended to prevent nutrient loss in organic farming?,"It is however very important that good management practices (see section 5.2, ‘Manures’ and section 6.3, ’Nutrient losses and gains’) are employed to prevent loss of nutrients from the system."
"Soil texture and structure play a critical role in soil erosion risk. Soils low in clay and high in silt or fine sands are more prone to erosion, especially on steep slopes. Well-structured soils, with better aggregation, are significantly less susceptible than poorly structured soils.",How do soil texture and structure influence the risk of soil erosion?,"Soil texture, soil structure and slope are very important in determining erosion risk. Soils which are low in clay and high in silt, fine sands, and steeply sloping fields, are most at risk. Well structured soils are much less at risk than poorly structured soils."
