why are farmers are often advised to spray pesticides in the morning.,"Temperature and humidity: Morning hours typically have cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels, which create favorable conditions for effective pesticide application. Low temperatures reduce the risk of evaporation, allowing the pesticide to stay on the plant surfaces longer. Higher humidity helps the pesticide droplets to spread and adhere to the plant surfaces.

Wind conditions: Generally, wind speeds are lower during the morning hours, reducing the risk of pesticide drift. Calm or gentle breezes help ensure that the pesticide is applied to the target plants without being carried away to non-target areas.

Pest activity: Many pests, such as insects and mites, tend to be more active during the early morning hours. By spraying at this time, the pesticide can directly target and control the pests while they are actively feeding or moving.

Preservation of beneficial insects: Spraying in the morning allows beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies, to forage on flowers and perform pollination activities during the day. Since these insects are crucial for crop pollination and ecological balance, it is important to minimize their exposure to pesticides. Spraying in the morning allows the pesticide residues to degrade or dry off before the peak activity of beneficial insects."

If monkeys or other animals are causing damage to your crops, it is generally recommended to explore non-lethal methods of managing wildlife, such as implementing deterrents, using fencing or netting, or seeking assistance from local wildlife authorities or conservation organizations. They may be able to provide guidance and solutions for addressing wildlife conflicts in a legal and humane manner.

give symptoms of cassava root rot,"ytophthora root rot: This is caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora spp. It leads to root decay and can result in wilting and stunted growth of the cassava plant.

Bacterial root rot: This is caused by bacteria such as Erwinia spp. and Pectobacterium spp., which infect the cassava roots and cause rotting and tissue breakdown.

Poor soil drainage: Excessive moisture in the soil can lead to root rot, as it creates favorable conditions for fungal and bacterial pathogens to thrive.

Poor soil health: Nutritional deficiencies, high soil acidity, or other soil-related issues can weaken cassava plants and make them more susceptible to root rot."
Explain how agronomic practices can be used to impact on the extent of damage done by crop pests? ,"Crop rotation: Rotating crops helps disrupt the life cycles of pests and reduces the buildup of pest populations. By alternating different crops in the same field, pests that are specific to a particular crop are less likely to persist and cause significant damage.

Proper planting time and spacing: Planting crops at the appropriate time and with the correct spacing can promote healthy plant growth and vigor. Well-spaced plants have better air circulation, reducing the favorable conditions for pests and diseases to spread. Timely planting can also help avoid critical pest infestation periods.

Field sanitation: Proper field sanitation involves removing crop residues, weeds, and other debris from the field. These residues can harbor pests and diseases, providing a breeding ground for future infestations. Removing crop debris and maintaining clean field conditions can help reduce pest populations.

Use of resistant or tolerant varieties: Planting crop varieties that have natural resistance or tolerance to specific pests can greatly reduce pest damage. Resistant varieties have built-in genetic traits that make them less susceptible to pest attacks. By choosing and planting resistant or tolerant varieties, farmers can minimize the impact of pests on their crops."

Observe the symptoms, such as leaf discoloration, wilting, lesions, or any other unusual signs. You can consult local agricultural extension services, agricultural experts, or plant pathologists to help identify the disease accurately.

Isolate and remove infected plants: If the disease is confirmed, promptly isolate and remove the infected plants from the field. This prevents further spread of the disease to healthy plants. Properly dispose of the infected plants by burning, burying, or removing them from the field.

Sanitize tools and equipment: Clean and sanitize any tools, equipment, or machinery that have come into contact with the infected plants. This helps prevent the disease from spreading to other fields or areas.

Implement cultural practices: Adopt cultural practices that can help manage or control the disease. These may include adjusting planting density, optimizing nutrition and irrigation practices, and practicing crop rotation. Some diseases may be controlled by removing alternate host plants or weeds that can serve as reservoirs for the pathogens.

Seek expert advice: Consult local agricultural extension services, agricultural experts, or plant pathologists for specific recommendations on disease management strategies. They can provide guidance on appropriate fungicides or other control measures if necessary.

Monitor and scout regularly: Continuously monitor the field to track the spread and severity of the disease. Regular scouting helps identify any new infections and allows for timely intervention."
