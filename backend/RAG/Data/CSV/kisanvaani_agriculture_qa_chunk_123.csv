"what are difference between Nase 14, Nase 3, and Nase 9 are different varieties of cassava.","Maturity period: Nase 14 is an early-maturing variety, typically reaching maturity in about 9-12 months after planting. Nase 3 and Nase 9 are mid-late maturing varieties, taking around 12-15 months to mature.

Yield potential: Nase 14 is known for its high yield potential, producing a good amount of cassava roots per unit area. Nase 3 and Nase 9 also have decent yield potential but may be slightly lower compared to Nase 14.

Pest and disease resistance: Nase 14 has shown good resistance to major pests and diseases that affect cassava, such as cassava mosaic disease and cassava bacterial blight. Nase 3 and Nase 9 also exhibit some level of resistance but may be relatively less resistant compared to Nase 14.

Root quality: The root qualities of these varieties may vary. Nase 14 is known for its relatively higher starch content, which is desirable for certain cassava-based products. Nase 3 and Nase 9 may have similar or slightly lower starch content but can still provide good quality roots.

Adaptability: These varieties have been bred to be adaptable to different agro-ecological zones. However, their specific adaptability may vary, and it is recommended to select the variety that suits the specific growing conditions of the area."
