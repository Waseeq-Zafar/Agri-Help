what factors contribute to the spread of CMD.,"Viral infection: The disease is caused by the presence of begomoviruses, particularly African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV). These viruses infect cassava plants and cause characteristic symptoms.

Vector transmission: Whiteflies feed on the sap of infected cassava plants, acquiring the virus. When they subsequently feed on healthy plants, they transmit the virus, leading to new infections. The whiteflies are efficient vectors and can quickly spread the disease within a cassava-growing area."
What facilitates farm yard manure to loosen upper soil layers? ," Farm yard manure is rich in organic matter, which improves soil structure and promotes aggregation. Organic matter helps to bind soil particles together, creating pore spaces and improving soil porosity. This allows for better air and water movement in the soil, leading to improved soil structure and less compacted soil.

Is it criminal if i kill monkeys spoiling my crops,"I am not a legal expert, but the legality of killing monkeys or any wildlife species largely depends on the laws and regulations of your country or region. In many places, wildlife is protected by law, and killing or harming them without proper authorization can be illegal and subject to penalties.

If monkeys or other animals are causing damage to your crops, it is generally recommended to explore non-lethal methods of managing wildlife, such as implementing deterrents, using fencing or netting, or seeking assistance from local wildlife authorities or conservation organizations. They may be able to provide guidance and solutions for addressing wildlife conflicts in a legal and humane manner.
