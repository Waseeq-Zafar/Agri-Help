What are the benefits of processing and packaging low crops,"Value addition: Processing and packaging add value to the crops, making them more marketable and increasing their economic value. Processed products, such as cassava flour, starch, chips, or other derived products, often have higher market demand and can fetch higher prices than raw crops.

Longer shelf life: Proper processing and packaging techniques can help extend the shelf life of low crops. By reducing moisture content, controlling microbial growth, and protecting against pests and spoilage, processed and packaged products can be stored for longer periods, reducing post-harvest losses.

Market access and diversification: Processed and packaged products have better market access compared to raw crops. They can be transported more easily, reach distant markets, and cater to specific consumer demands. This diversification allows farmers to explore different market channels and potentially increase their income.

Convenience and consumer appeal: Processed and packaged products offer convenience and ease of use for consumers. They are often ready-to-use or require minimal preparation, making them more attractive to busy consumers. Additionally, attractive packaging and labeling can enhance product appeal and create brand recognition.

Value chain development: Processing and packaging low crops can contribute to the development of the agricultural value chain. It creates opportunities for agro-processing industries, job creation, and skills development. This can have positive socio-economic impacts on rural communities and contribute to overall agricultural development."

Explain how agronomic practices can be used to impact on the extent of damage done by crop pests? ,"Crop rotation: Rotating crops helps disrupt the life cycles of pests and reduces the buildup of pest populations. By alternating different crops in the same field, pests that are specific to a particular crop are less likely to persist and cause significant damage.

Proper planting time and spacing: Planting crops at the appropriate time and with the correct spacing can promote healthy plant growth and vigor. Well-spaced plants have better air circulation, reducing the favorable conditions for pests and diseases to spread. Timely planting can also help avoid critical pest infestation periods.

Field sanitation: Proper field sanitation involves removing crop residues, weeds, and other debris from the field. These residues can harbor pests and diseases, providing a breeding ground for future infestations. Removing crop debris and maintaining clean field conditions can help reduce pest populations.

Use of resistant or tolerant varieties: Planting crop varieties that have natural resistance or tolerance to specific pests can greatly reduce pest damage. Resistant varieties have built-in genetic traits that make them less susceptible to pest attacks. By choosing and planting resistant or tolerant varieties, farmers can minimize the impact of pests on their crops."

list symptoms of maize streak disease.,"Stunted growth: Infected maize plants often exhibit stunted growth compared to healthy plants. The plants may fail to reach their normal height and size.

Necrosis or browning: As the infection progresses, the chlorotic streaks may turn necrotic or brown. This necrosis can extend to the entire leaf blade, resulting in a scorched or burnt appearance.

Leaf curling and twisting: Infected maize leaves may exhibit curling and twisting, with a downward or upward curling of the leaf margins. This distortion is more prominent in severe infections.

Reduced grain production: Maize plants infected with maize streak virus often experience a reduction in grain production. Infected plants may have fewer or smaller ears, and the kernels may be poorly developed or discolored.
