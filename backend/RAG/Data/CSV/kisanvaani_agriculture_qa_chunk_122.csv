How long should artificial fertilizers be used in a certain piece of land in order to avoid degradation? ,"To prevent soil degradation, it is also recommended that farmers periodically test their soil for nutrient levels and pH and adjust their fertilizer application rates based on the test results. This can help ensure that fertilizers are being applied in appropriate amounts and prevent the accumulation of excess nutrients in the soil, which can lead to environmental pollution.A year after a year, Fertilization depends on crop and organic matter content of the soil. it would be advisable to always apply fertilizers after soil analysis. however, inherently, our soils (especially in buganda) are poor. by default, the lack n, p and k. soil erosion is also causing lot of depletion. it is advisable that the inorganic fertilizers be applies every cropping season. remember fertilizers will not work well if the soil does not have organic matter"
