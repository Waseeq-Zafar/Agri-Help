"Under SRI, irrigation should be applied as needed to keep the field moist but not flooded.",How should the field's moisture be maintained during irrigation under SRI?,"After that, crop is irrigated only as per the requirement under SRI to maintain proper moisture in the field. The care is taken that the field is kept moist and not flooded."
"Irrigation should be applied in moderate amounts, preferably during the morning or late evening hours when it is not too hot.",When should irrigation be applied?,Irrigation should be applied in moderate amount preferably during morning or late evening hours when it is not too hot.
"Planting seedlings with soil-intact roots during gap filling ensures a proper crop stand, which is crucial for achieving higher yields.",What effect does planting seedlings with soil-intact roots have on gap filling?,"For gap filling, seedlings along with soil intact roots should be used. Gap filling will help to ensure proper crop stand for higher yield."
"The field size rope demarcated at equal lengths helps ensure proper transplanting in line and at equal distances, thus promoting even growth and efficient space utilization.",What is the purpose of using a field size rope during transplanting?,A field size rope well demarcated at equal lengths of 25cm / 30cm and held straight along field facilitates proper transplanting in line and at equal distance.
"Irrigation should begin with a thin layer of water for seedling establishment, and subsequently, the crop should be irrigated as required to maintain proper moisture levels without flooding.",How should irrigation be managed to maintain proper moisture in the field?,"Only a thin layer of water above surface or saturated condition is required for proper establishment of seedlings. After that, crop is irrigated only as per the requirement under SRI ..."
"Timing transplanting to early morning or late evening minimizes heat stress and ensures seedlings are quickly established, reducing the risk of transplant shock and improving survival rates.",Why is the timing of transplanting critical for seedlings?,Transplanting should be done in early morning or late evening hours as early as possible after removing the seedlings from the seed bed preferably within 15 to 30 minutes of uprooting.
"For proper establishment, seedlings require only a thin layer of water above the soil surface or a saturated condition—anything more can lead to water logging and hinder the development of a robust root system.",What specific conditions are necessary for proper seedling establishment during irrigation?,Only a thin layer of water above surface or saturated condition is required for proper establishment of seedlings...
"Minimizing transplanting trauma involves gently plugging the tiny roots of the seedlings into the soil, thereby reducing root damage and promoting a smoother transition and establishment.",How can transplanting trauma be minimized for seedlings?,The tiny roots of the seedling should be gently plugged in the soil for minimizing the trauma during transplanting.
"Effective gap filling involves using seedlings with soil-intact roots from an SRI-nursery setup, placed in spots where initial seedlings failed to establish, ensuring a uniform and healthy crop stand.",Describe the method for effective gap filling in an SRI-nursery setup.,"Gap filling may be done wherever seedlings fail to establish... For gap filling, seedlings along with soil intact roots should be used."
"Maintaining proper moisture under SRI practices avoids flooding, ensures optimal water usage, enhances root aeration, improves nutrient uptake, and prevents fungal diseases and root rot, leading to healthier crop growth and higher yields.",What are the benefits of maintaining proper moisture in the field under SRI practices?,The care is taken that the field is kept moist and not flooded.
