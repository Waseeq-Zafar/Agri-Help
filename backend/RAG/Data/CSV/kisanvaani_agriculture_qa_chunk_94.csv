What fertilizer is recommended for maize at planting stage?,"For maize at the planting stage, a fertilizer high in phosphorus (P) is recommended. Phosphorus plays a crucial role in promoting root development and early plant establishment. One commonly used fertilizer for maize at planting is diammonium phosphate (DAP), which typically has a ratio of 18-46-0, indicating 18% nitrogen (N), 46% phosphorus (P), and no potassium (K). This fertilizer provides a readily available source of phosphorus for the young maize plants.
"
what are the demerits of leaving maize stalks in the garden after harvesting.,"Disease and pest carryover: Some diseases and pests can overwinter or survive on maize stalks, potentially infecting or infesting future crops. It is advisable to remove and properly dispose of stalks affected by diseases or pests to minimize the risk.
Crop rotation: Leaving maize stalks in the same area may hinder proper crop rotation, which is important for managing pests, diseases, and nutrient imbalances.
If you decide to leave maize stalks in the garden as organic matter and mulch, it is recommended to chop or shred the stalks into smaller pieces to facilitate decomposition. It is also important to monitor for any signs of disease or pests and take appropriate measures if necessary. Overall, proper management of maize stalks can contribute to soil fertility and sustainability, but it is essential to consider specific farm conditions and crop rotation practices."

list symptoms of maize streak disease.,"Stunted growth: Infected maize plants often exhibit stunted growth compared to healthy plants. The plants may fail to reach their normal height and size.

Chlorotic streaks or stripes: One of the characteristic symptoms of maize streak virus is the appearance of chlorotic streaks or stripes on the leaves. These streaks are usually pale yellow to white in color and run parallel to the leaf veins.

Necrosis or browning: As the infection progresses, the chlorotic streaks may turn necrotic or brown. This necrosis can extend to the entire leaf blade, resulting in a scorched or burnt appearance.

Leaf curling and twisting: Infected maize leaves may exhibit curling and twisting, with a downward or upward curling of the leaf margins. This distortion is more prominent in severe infections.

Reduced grain production: Maize plants infected with maize streak virus often experience a reduction in grain production. Infected plants may have fewer or smaller ears, and the kernels may be poorly developed or discolored.

what factors contribute to the spread of CMD.,"Viral infection: The disease is caused by the presence of begomoviruses, particularly African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV). These viruses infect cassava plants and cause characteristic symptoms.
