"Raised nursery beds should be 1.0 m wide and 10 m long, surrounded by 30-40 cm drainage cum irrigation channels. Beds are covered with a 4-5 cm thick mixture of soil and decomposed F.Y.M. This setup ensures adequate soil aeration, drainage, and nutrient supply, promoting healthy seedling development.",Explain the structure and purpose of raised nursery beds within a well-prepared paddy seed bed.,"4.1.1 Nursery on Raised Beds : It is always advisable to raise nursery on raised beds. In a well prepared paddy seed bed, raised beds of 1.0 m width and 10 m length should be prepared. Around these beds 30-40 cm drainage cum irrigation channels are prepared. On these nursery beds 1:1 soil: decomposed FYM mixture is spread to 4-5 cm thickness (Fig. 4.3)."
"F.Y.M-treated seed beds offer numerous advantages over untreated soil. The addition of F.Y.M. improves soil’s physical, biological, and chemical properties, supplying essential nutrients. This enhances plant growth and root development in loose, well-aerated soil, which is crucial for healthy seedlings.",What are the specific advantages of a seed bed treated with F.Y.M over untreated soil?,"The use of sufficient quantity of F.Y.M. will not only improve the soil physical, biological and chemical properties but also supply required quantity of nutrients to the plants and plant growth will be much better with sound root development in loose soil."
"Pre-sowing irrigation triggers the germination of weed seeds present in the soil or manure. By irrigating twice, these emergent weed seedlings can be destroyed during the seed bed preparation phase, minimizing weed competition for nutrients and space, leading to healthier primary crop growth.",How does pre-sowing irrigation affect weed management in seed beds?,After adding the F.Y.M in the soil the seed bed should be irrigated twice so that the weed seed present in soil/manure can germinate and are destroyed in the process of seed bed preparation before sowing of seed.
"A 1:1 soil and decomposed Farm Yard Manure (F.Y.M.) mixture is spread on nursery beds to a thickness of 4-5 cm. This mixture enriches the soil with nutrients from F.Y.M and ensures a suitable texture for optimal seedling growth, supporting healthy root development.",What type of mixture is spread on the nursery beds and why?,On these nursery beds 1:1 soil: decomposed FYM mixture is spread to 4-5 cm thickness
"Precautions to ensure a healthy nursery include: using a well-prepared seed bed with the recommended nutrient mix, incorporating decomposed F.Y.M., and irrigating the bed to control weeds. Raised nursery beds with proper drainage and nutrient-rich soil layers also contribute to healthier seedling development.",What precautions should be followed to ensure a healthy nursery?,Following precautions will ensure healthy nursery.
"Figure 4.3 depicts a healthy nursery grown on a raised bed. This visual highlights the successful implementation of nursery bed preparation guidelines, emphasizing the importance of raised beds, proper nutrient mix, and appropriate irrigation and drainage practices for fostering healthy seedlings.",What is depicted in Figure 4.3 and its importance in the nursery preparation context?,Fig. 4.3: Healthy nursery grown on raised bed
"Selecting a good paddy variety is important in SRI as it ensures the crop has the characteristic of profuse tillering, leading to better yield and productivity.",Why is the selection of a good paddy variety important in SRI?,"4.1.2 Selection of variety : To realize full potential of SRI, it is important to select good paddy variety which has characteristic of profuse tillering (Fig. 4.4)."
"For raising a nursery in SRI, it is recommended to use good quality healthy seeds at a rate of 6 kg per hectare.",How much seed is recommended for raising a nursery in SRI?,4.1.3 Seed Quality and Treatment : Good quality healthy seed @6kg/ha should be used for raising nursery for SRI.
Seeds are soaked for 24 hours in 10 liters of water containing 20-25 grams of bavistin and 2 grams of streptcycline. This treatment ensures healthy seedlings.,What is the seed treatment process for SRI?,4.1.3 Seed Quality and Treatment : Good quality healthy seed @6kg/ha should be used for raising nursery for SRI. It should be soaked for 24 hrs in a 10 litre water solution having 20-25 gm bavistin + 2gm streptcycline.
"After soaking, the treated seeds are incubated in a moist gunny cloth for another 24 hours to promote sprouting.",What is the next step after soaking the seeds for SRI?,4.1.4 Seed Sowing : Treated seed is incubated in moist gunny cloth for another 24 hour for sprouting.
"During seed sowing in SRI, nursery beds are preferably irrigated using sprinklers or fountains to ensure even water distribution.",How are nursery beds irrigated during seed sowing in SRI?,4.1.4 Seed Sowing : Nursery beds are irrigated preferably using sprinkling /fountain.
"For sowing sprouted seeds, a mixture of soil and Farmyard Manure (FYM) in a 1:1 ratio is spread in a thin layer of 1-2 cm.",How is soil prepared for sowing sprouted seeds in nursery beds under SRI?,"4.1.4 Seed Sowing : After sowing the seeds, again 1:1 soil-FYM mixture is spread in a thin layer of 1-2 cm."
"Regular watering is essential to maintain moist conditions in nursery beds, ensuring optimal growth and preventing waterlogging.",Why is regular watering important in SRI nursery beds?,4.1.5 Regular watering : Regular irrigation in to the channels formed around the nursery beds is provided preferably in the mornings /evenings for maintaining moist condition in nursery beds.
"Weeding, if necessary, is conducted twice during the SRI nursery period to keep the beds free from weeds.",When is weeding done during the SRI nursery period?,4.1.5 Regular watering : Weeding if required is done twice during the period.
"Sprinkling water using fountains enhances aeration and prevents nursery bed flooding, promoting healthier seedling growth.",What is the role of sprinkling water in SRI nursery beds?,4.1.5 Regular watering : Sprinkling of water using fountain is also done as and when required. These practices are aimed at better aeration as well as avoiding the flooding of nursery bed.
"According to SRI guidelines, it is important to maintain moist conditions in nursery beds by regularly irrigating channels around the beds.",What is important to maintain in the nursery beds according to SRI guidelines?,4.1.5 Regular watering : Regular irrigation in to the channels formed around the nursery beds is provided preferably in the mornings /evenings for maintaining moist condition in nursery beds.
"Seed quality and treatment play crucial roles in ensuring healthy rice seedlings under SRI. Good quality, healthy seeds, when treated by soaking in a solution containing bavistin and streptcycline for 24 hours, are protected from diseases. This pre-treatment promotes healthier growth and robust seedlings.",Explain the role of seed quality and treatment in ensuring healthy rice seedlings under SRI.,4.1.3 Seed Quality and Treatment : Good quality healthy seed @6kg/ha should be used for raising nursery for SRI.
