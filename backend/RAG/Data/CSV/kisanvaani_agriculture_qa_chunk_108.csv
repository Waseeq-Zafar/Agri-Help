This improves soil structure, enhances nutrient retention, and promotes microbial activity.

Crop rotation and diversification: Rotate maize with leguminous crops (such as beans, peas, or clover) that fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and improve soil nitrogen levels. Crop rotation also helps break pest and disease cycles and promotes overall soil health.

Green manure cover crops: Plant cover crops like clover, vetch, or hairy vetch during fallow periods. These cover crops add organic matter, prevent soil erosion, and improve soil structure.

I planted maize the past season and had used cow dung while sowing the drought  affected the maize i intend to plant maize again in the same place do i need to apply cow dung again or i plant with out.,"If you intend to plant maize again in the same place where you had previously used cow dung and experienced drought, you can still apply cow dung to the soil to improve its fertility. Cow dung is a good source of organic matter and nutrients that can improve soil health and provide the necessary nutrients for plant growth.

However, if you had applied a large amount of cow dung in the previous season and the soil is still rich in organic matter, you may not need to apply more cow dung. Over-application of organic matter can lead to nutrient imbalances and other soil problems. Therefore, it is important to consider the current nutrient status of the soil before adding more organic matter."
