"At the initial tillering stage in SRI, plants require minimal water due to limited vegetative growth. Once roots develop well, 3-4 days of superficial dryness and field cracks are tolerable, indicating their adaptability. This reduced dependency on water early on highlights SRI's efficiency in water management.",Discuss the adaptability of SRI plants during initial tillering with regards to water requirements.,"In SRI at the beginning of tillering, there is still not much vegetative growth and the plant only requires a small amount of water. Subsequently, when the root system has been developed well, 3 or 4 days of superficial dryness should not cause alarm even if some cracks develop in the field."
"In SRI, irrigation schedules are adjustable based on rainfall availability. When rainfall is insufficient, moderate, appropriately-timed irrigation compensates, ensuring optimal soil moisture. This flexibility in irrigation emphasizes SRI’s adaptability and its capacity to conserve water by supplementing only as the environment demands.",How does the irrigation schedule fluctuate based on rainfall in SRI?,During growth period of the crop irrigation will only be needed if rainfall is inadequate and such irrigation should be applied in moderate amounts and at favorable times.
"Early transplantation within 15-30 minutes after uprooting in SRI minimizes plant stress and ensures quick adaptation. This prompt action, coupled with initially minimal water requirements during the tillering phase, ensures robust plant health and vigorous early growth, laying a strong foundation for subsequent development stages.",Explain the significance of early transplantation and its effect on the rice plant in SRI.,"It should be done very soon after removing the seedlings from the seedbed and within 15 to 30 minutes after the tiny plants have been gently uprooted. In SRI at the beginning of tillering, there is still not much vegetative growth and the plant only requires a small amount of water."
"Proper seedling uprooting, ensuring minimal root damage, is crucial in SRI for maintaining productivity. Healthy, less-stressed seedlings quickly adapt, establishing robust growth. Improper uprooting, causing root damage, leads to stress, delayed growth, and reduced vigor, ultimately affecting yield and efficiency of the SRI method.",What is the role of proper seedling uprooting in achieving SRI productivity and how can improper uprooting affect it?,The success of SRI is primarily dependent upon raising healthy and robust nursery which should be ready within 9-14 days of sowing. Care should be taken in uprooting the healthy seedling with minimum damage to the root system.
The ideal time for irrigation in the SRI method is preferably in the morning hours or late evening. Irrigation should be avoided during noon when it is too hot.,What is the ideal time for irrigation in the SRI method?,"preferably in the morning hours or late evening (Fig. 4.2). Irrigation should be avoided during noon, when it is too hot."
