why are farmers are often advised to spray pesticides in the morning.,"Temperature and humidity: Morning hours typically have cooler temperatures and higher humidity levels, which create favorable conditions for effective pesticide application. Low temperatures reduce the risk of evaporation, allowing the pesticide to stay on the plant surfaces longer. Higher humidity helps the pesticide droplets to spread and adhere to the plant surfaces.

Wind conditions: Generally, wind speeds are lower during the morning hours, reducing the risk of pesticide drift. Calm or gentle breezes help ensure that the pesticide is applied to the target plants without being carried away to non-target areas.

Pest activity: Many pests, such as insects and mites, tend to be more active during the early morning hours. By spraying at this time, the pesticide can directly target and control the pests while they are actively feeding or moving.

Preservation of beneficial insects: Spraying in the morning allows beneficial insects, such as bees and butterflies, to forage on flowers and perform pollination activities during the day. Since these insects are crucial for crop pollination and ecological balance, it is important to minimize their exposure to pesticides. Spraying in the morning allows the pesticide residues to degrade or dry off before the peak activity of beneficial insects."
