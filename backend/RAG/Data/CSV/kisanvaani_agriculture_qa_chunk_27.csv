Is it criminal if i kill monkeys spoiling my crops,"I am not a legal expert, but the legality of killing monkeys or any wildlife species largely depends on the laws and regulations of your country or region. In many places, wildlife is protected by law, and killing or harming them without proper authorization can be illegal and subject to penalties.

If monkeys or other animals are causing damage to your crops, it is generally recommended to explore non-lethal methods of managing wildlife, such as implementing deterrents, using fencing or netting, or seeking assistance from local wildlife authorities or conservation organizations. They may be able to provide guidance and solutions for addressing wildlife conflicts in a legal and humane manner.

list ways how maize streak disease transmission occurs.,"Infection of the maize plant: The virus is initially introduced into the maize plant through a bite by the maize streak virus vector or ""leafhopper"" insect, which feeds on the sap of the plant.

Replication and spread: Once the virus has infected the plant, it replicates and spreads within the plant, causing damage to the leaves, stem, and grains of the plant.

Transmission to new plants: The virus can be transmitted to new plants when an infected leafhopper feeds on a healthy plant. The virus can also be spread through infected seeds or plant debris.

Environmental factors: Environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and the presence of other pests and diseases can affect the severity and spread of MSD."
Is it a good practice to apply farm yard manure and compost manure at the same time? ,"Yes, it is generally a good practice to apply farmyard manure (FYM) and compost manure together, as they can complement each other in improving soil fertility and crop productivity.
