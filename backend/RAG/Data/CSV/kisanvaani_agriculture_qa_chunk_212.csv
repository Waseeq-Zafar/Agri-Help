why do cassava plants may shed their leaves during dry season.,"Water stress: Cassava plants have a deep root system that helps them access water from deeper soil layers. However, during prolonged dry periods, the availability of water may become limited, leading to water stress in the plants. As a survival mechanism, cassava plants shed their leaves to reduce water loss through transpiration and conserve moisture.

Nutrient deficiency: Inadequate nutrient availability, particularly nitrogen, can cause cassava plants to shed their leaves. During the dry season, nutrient uptake by the plants may be hampered, leading to nutrient deficiencies and subsequent leaf drop.

Pests and diseases: Dry conditions can increase the vulnerability of cassava plants to pests and diseases. Insect infestations, such as cassava green mites or cassava mealybugs, and diseases like cassava mosaic disease or cassava bacterial blight, can cause leaf damage and subsequent leaf shedding.

Natural plant response: In some cases, leaf shedding during the dry season may be a natural response of cassava plants to conserve energy and focus resources on survival. By shedding leaves, the plant can reduce its overall water and nutrient requirements and redirect resources to essential parts such as the stem and tuberous roots."

 can delaying weeding cassava cause cassava mosaic,"Delaying weeding in cassava fields can create favorable conditions for the spread of Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD). Weeds can act as alternative hosts for the whiteflies that transmit the virus responsible for CMD.
