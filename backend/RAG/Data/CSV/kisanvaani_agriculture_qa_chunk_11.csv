Farmers always ask for the reason why nitrogenous fertilizer are only top dress,"Nitrogen uptake timing: Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and is necessary for various physiological processes, including leaf and stem development. However, nitrogen is a highly mobile nutrient in the soil and can easily leach or wash away if applied too early in the growing season. Therefore, to ensure that the plants have an adequate and readily available nitrogen supply during their active growth phase, nitrogenous fertilizers are often applied as top dressing when the plants are well-established.

Crop demand for nitrogen: Many crops, including maize, have a high demand for nitrogen during their vegetative growth stage. By applying nitrogenous fertilizers as top dressing during this period, it helps meet the crop's nutrient requirements when they need it the most. This timing allows for optimal nitrogen utilization by the plants and promotes vigorous vegetative growth.

Minimizing nitrogen losses: By applying nitrogenous fertilizers as top dressing, farmers can better manage and minimize nitrogen losses from leaching or volatilization. Top dressing allows for a more targeted application directly to the root zone, reducing the risk of nutrient runoff or wastage.

Katumani: Katumani is a bean variety that is popular in regions with heavy rainfall. It has good water tolerance and can withstand periods of excessive moisture."
why do cassava plants may shed their leaves during dry season.,"Water stress: Cassava plants have a deep root system that helps them access water from deeper soil layers. However, during prolonged dry periods, the availability of water may become limited, leading to water stress in the plants. As a survival mechanism, cassava plants shed their leaves to reduce water loss through transpiration and conserve moisture.

Nutrient deficiency: Inadequate nutrient availability, particularly nitrogen, can cause cassava plants to shed their leaves. During the dry season, nutrient uptake by the plants may be hampered, leading to nutrient deficiencies and subsequent leaf drop.

Pests and diseases: Dry conditions can increase the vulnerability of cassava plants to pests and diseases. Insect infestations, such as cassava green mites or cassava mealybugs, and diseases like cassava mosaic disease or cassava bacterial blight, can cause leaf damage and subsequent leaf shedding.

Natural plant response: In some cases, leaf shedding during the dry season may be a natural response of cassava plants to conserve energy and focus resources on survival. By shedding leaves, the plant can reduce its overall water and nutrient requirements and redirect resources to essential parts such as the stem and tuberous roots."
why are farmers encouraged to do proper seed bed preparation.,"Proper seed bed preparation creates a favorable environment for seed germination.
