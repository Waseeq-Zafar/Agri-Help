They also have high running costs and provide poor burial of residues, although they offer fair mixing of soil and residues.",What is a notable downside of using rotary cultivators for soil work?,Rotary cultivators Incorporation of crop residues and amendments Poor burial of residues; very damaging to soil structure; high running cost; can chop and spread rhizome weeds
"A unique benefit of using a power harrow is its rapid tilth production, being able to create fine seedbeds quickly without bringing up clods or stones. Power harrow/drill combinations can create seedbeds and plant in one pass.",What is a unique benefit of using a power harrow for seedbed preparation?,Power harrow Rapid tilth production ‘Force’ seedbeds quickly; can work to 250mm without bringing up clods or stones; power harrow/drill combinations can create seedbeds and plant in one pass
"A mouldboard plough is considered energy-intensive because it disrupts the soil life, exposes crop residues and organic matter, and can cause plough pans. Its thorough incorporation of residues and creating a clean field require more energy.",Why might a mouldboard plough be considered energy-intensive?,Mouldboard ploughing Incorporation of Produces clean field Disrupts soil life; exposes crop residues and organic matter; can cause amendments plough pans; energy intensive
"One limitation of using a disc plough in wet soils is that it is less effective at burying crop residues compared to dry soils. It does not completely bury residues, making it less efficient under wet conditions.",What is one limitation of using a disc plough in wet soils?,Disc plough Incorporation of Quicker than mould- Does not completely bury crop residues and board; no plough pans; residues; less effective in useful in very hard soils wet soils; can chop and spread rhizome weeds
A spading machine has a low work rate despite its benefits of not damaging soil structure and being useful on silts due to its expensive nature and slower operational speed. These factors contribute to its overall low work rate.,Why might a spading machine have a low work rate despite its benefits?,Spading machine Primary cultivation Does not damage soil structure; especially useful on silts; low energy requirements Expensive machine; low work rate
"The use of a power harrow can be potentially expensive due to its high horsepower requirements and maintenance costs. Additionally, while it produces rapid tilth and creates seedbeds efficiently, it is not good at burying residues and can damage the soil structure.",What factors make the use of a power harrow potentially expensive?,Power harrow Rapid tilth production ‘Force’ seedbeds quickly; can work to 250mm without bringing up  clods or stones; power harrow/drill combinations can create seedbeds and plant in one pass Not good at burying  residues; can destroy soil structure; high horsepower  requirements
"Using a disc harrow causes less soil damage compared to a rotary cultivator. While both can chop and spread rhizome weeds, disc harrows are generally less damaging to soil structure and more efficient in covering large areas quickly, whereas rotary cultivators can severely damage soil structure.",How does using a disc harrow differ from using a rotary cultivator in terms of soil damage?,Disc harrow Shallow cultivation for incorporation of residues; secondary cultivations on ploughed ground Cover large areas quickly; useful for breaking up compacted soils; can chop and spread rhizome weeds Rotary cultivators Incorporation of crop residues and amendments Poor burial of residues; very damaging to soil structure; high running cost; can chop and spread rhizome weeds
