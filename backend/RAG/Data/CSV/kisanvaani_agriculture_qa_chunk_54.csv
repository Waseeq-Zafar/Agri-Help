what are the general steps for planting cassava stems.,"Select healthy cassava stems: Choose stems that are healthy, mature, and disease-free. Ideally, the stems should be about 20 to 30 cm long, and should have at least one node.

Cut the stems: Cut the stems into sections, each containing at least one node. The nodes are the points where the leaves and roots will grow.

Allow the cuttings to dry: Allow the cuttings to dry for a few hours in a shaded area. This will help to reduce the risk of fungal infection and other diseases.

Prepare the planting site: Clear the planting site of weeds and other debris, and loosen the soil to a depth of about 20 cm.

Plant the cuttings: Plant the cassava cuttings in the soil, burying them to a depth of about 5 to 10 cm. Space the cuttings about 1 meter apart.

Water the cuttings: Water the cuttings immediately after planting, and continue to water them regularly until they are established."
