what are some of the tips on how to best use PICS bags for storing maize grains.,"Clean and dry the grains: Before storing maize grains in PICS bags, make sure that they are thoroughly cleaned and dried to a moisture content of around 12-13%. This will help prevent mold and insect growth.

Fill the bags completely: Fill the PICS bags completely with the maize grains, leaving no empty space. This will help prevent the buildup of oxygen and moisture, which can lead to spoilage and insect growth.

Seal the bags tightly: After filling the bags with maize grains, seal them tightly using the PICS bag sealer or a heat sealer. Make sure that there are no holes or leaks in the bags, as this can allow air and moisture to enter.

Store the bags in a cool and dry place: Store the PICS bags in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight and sources of moisture. A well-ventilated room or a grain storage facility is ideal for storing PICS bags.

Check the bags regularly: Check the PICS bags regularly for any signs of damage, such as holes or leaks, and for any signs of insect or mold growth. If any damage or signs of infestation are found, take immediate action to prevent further damage."
