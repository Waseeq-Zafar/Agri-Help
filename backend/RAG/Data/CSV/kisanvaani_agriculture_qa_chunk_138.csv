What are the symptoms of maize streak disease,"Stunted growth: Infected plants often show stunted or reduced growth compared to healthy plants. The overall size of the plant is smaller, and it may fail to reach its normal height.

Yellowing or chlorosis: The leaves of infected plants exhibit yellowing or chlorosis. The chlorotic areas appear as irregular streaks or patches along the veins of the leaves. The yellowing may progress to the entire leaf, leading to leaf necrosis.

Leaf curling: Infected plants may exhibit curling or rolling of the leaves. The leaves may curl upwards or downwards, giving a distorted appearance.

Narrowing of leaves: The leaves of infected plants may become narrower and more erect than healthy leaves. This symptom is known as leaf strapiness."

how can farmers benefit from farmers organization,"Knowledge and information sharing: Farming organizations often serve as platforms for knowledge and information exchange among farmers. They provide access to training programs, workshops, seminars, and demonstrations on various agricultural practices, technologies, and market trends. This helps farmers stay updated on the latest farming techniques, best practices, and innovations, enabling them to improve their skills and productivity.

Collective bargaining power: By joining together in a farming organization, farmers can collectively negotiate better prices for their produce and access to inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers, and machinery. The organization can act as a unified voice, representing the interests and concerns of farmers to government authorities, agribusinesses, and other stakeholders, leading to improved market access and fairer trade terms.

Access to financial resources: Farming organizations can facilitate access to credit and financial resources for farmers. They may partner with financial institutions or develop their own revolving funds to provide affordable loans, savings schemes, and insurance products tailored to farmers' needs. This helps farmers overcome financial constraints, invest in their farms, and manage risks associated with farming.

Market linkages and value addition: Farming organizations can establish market linkages and connect farmers with potential buyers, processors, and exporters. They may engage in collective marketing initiatives, bulk sales, or value addition activities, such as processing and packaging, to enhance the marketability and profitability of farmers' produce. This can lead to better market prices, increased income, and improved market access for farmers.

Advocacy and representation: Farming organizations often engage in advocacy and policy dialogue on behalf of farmers. They can influence agricultural policies, regulations, and practices to create a favorable enabling environment for farming. By representing farmers' interests, they can address challenges, promote sustainable farming practices, and advocate for policies that support the growth and development of the agricultural sector.

Networking and collaboration: Being part of a farming organization allows farmers to network and collaborate with peers, experts, researchers, and other stakeholders in the agricultural sector. This fosters learning, collaboration, and innovation, as farmers can share experiences, exchange ideas, and collaborate on research, projects, and initiatives that benefit the farming community as a whole."
Can maize grow in relatively rocky soils?,"Soil drainage: Ensure that the rocky soil has adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging, as excessive water retention can negatively impact maize growth. Rocky soils with good drainage can be suitable for maize cultivation.
