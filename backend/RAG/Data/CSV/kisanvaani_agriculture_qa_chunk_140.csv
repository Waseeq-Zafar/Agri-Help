list symptoms of maize streak disease.,"Stunted growth: Infected maize plants often exhibit stunted growth compared to healthy plants. The plants may fail to reach their normal height and size.

Chlorotic streaks or stripes: One of the characteristic symptoms of maize streak virus is the appearance of chlorotic streaks or stripes on the leaves. These streaks are usually pale yellow to white in color and run parallel to the leaf veins.

Necrosis or browning: As the infection progresses, the chlorotic streaks may turn necrotic or brown. This necrosis can extend to the entire leaf blade, resulting in a scorched or burnt appearance.

Leaf curling and twisting: Infected maize leaves may exhibit curling and twisting, with a downward or upward curling of the leaf margins. This distortion is more prominent in severe infections.

Reduced grain production: Maize plants infected with maize streak virus often experience a reduction in grain production. Infected plants may have fewer or smaller ears, and the kernels may be poorly developed or discolored.
