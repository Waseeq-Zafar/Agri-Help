In high temperature and humidity, foliage may be killed. Stem lesions resemble leaf lesions and may girdle the plant if near the soil line. Fruit can also be infected, typically through the calyx or stem attachment, with lesions involving nearly the entire fruit and concentric rings present."
How does Early Blight spread and survive in tomato plants?,"The pathogen, Alternaria solani, spreads through wind and rain splashes. Under dry conditions, it survives in infected plant debris in the soil for up to three years and can also be seed-borne."
What management strategies can be used to control Early Blight in tomato plants?,"Management strategies include removal and destruction of crop debris and practicing crop rotation to minimize disease incidence. Additionally, spraying the crop with Mancozeb 0.2% can provide effective disease control."
What are the symptoms of Septoria Leaf Spot in tomato plants?,"Septoria Leaf Spot, caused by Septoria lycopersici, is characterized by numerous, small, grey, circular leaf spots with dark borders."
What is the pathogen responsible for Septoria Leaf Spot in tomato plants?,"The pathogen responsible for Septoria Leaf Spot is Septoria lycopersici. Its mycelium is septate, branched, initially hyaline, but darkens with age. Pycnidia are erumpent, and pycnidiospores are filiform, hyaline, and septate."
How does Septoria Leaf Spot spread and survive in tomato plants?,"Septoria lycopersici spreads via wind, rain splashes, insects, and on the hands and clothing of tomato pickers. It survives from one season to the next on infested crop debris and solanaceous weeds, as well as on or in the seed."
What management strategies can be used to control Septoria Leaf Spot in tomato plants?,"Management strategies include removal and destruction of affected plant parts, seed treatment with Thiram or Dithane M-45 (2 g/kg seed) to check seed-borne infection, and field spraying with Mancozeb 0.2% for effective disease control."
What are the symptoms of Bacterial Wilt in tomato plants?,"Characteristic symptoms include rapid and complete wilting of normal, grown-up plants, with lower leaves dropping before wilting. In advanced cases, the pathogen may invade the cortex and pith, causing yellow-brown discoloration of tissues. When infected plant parts are cut and immersed in clear water, a white streak of bacterial ooze is seen coming out from cut ends."
What is the pathogen responsible for Bacterial Wilt in tomato plants?,"The pathogen is Burkholderia solanacearum, a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that often occurs in pairs. It is motile, with 1–4 flagella, and its optimum temperature for growth is 30-37˚C."
How does Bacterial Wilt spread and survive in tomato plants?,"The bacterium survives in soil and spreads through irrigation water and by transplanting infected seedlings. It can survive for up to 3 years in fallow land and indefinitely in cultivated land. Alternative hosts such as chili, eggplant, groundnut, potato, and tobacco help it survive between tomato crops."
