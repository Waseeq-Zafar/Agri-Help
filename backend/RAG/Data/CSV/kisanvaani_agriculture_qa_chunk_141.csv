What are the benefits of processing and packaging low crops,"Value addition: Processing and packaging add value to the crops, making them more marketable and increasing their economic value. Processed products, such as cassava flour, starch, chips, or other derived products, often have higher market demand and can fetch higher prices than raw crops.

Longer shelf life: Proper processing and packaging techniques can help extend the shelf life of low crops. By reducing moisture content, controlling microbial growth, and protecting against pests and spoilage, processed and packaged products can be stored for longer periods, reducing post-harvest losses.

Market access and diversification: Processed and packaged products have better market access compared to raw crops. They can be transported more easily, reach distant markets, and cater to specific consumer demands. This diversification allows farmers to explore different market channels and potentially increase their income.

Convenience and consumer appeal: Processed and packaged products offer convenience and ease of use for consumers. They are often ready-to-use or require minimal preparation, making them more attractive to busy consumers. Additionally, attractive packaging and labeling can enhance product appeal and create brand recognition.

Value chain development: Processing and packaging low crops can contribute to the development of the agricultural value chain. It creates opportunities for agro-processing industries, job creation, and skills development. This can have positive socio-economic impacts on rural communities and contribute to overall agricultural development."
