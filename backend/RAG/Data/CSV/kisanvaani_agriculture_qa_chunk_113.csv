Farmers are focused on conserving water for several reasons,1) Farmers know water wasted could mean a lack of the resource for future crops. 2) Water is expensive. Water wasted is money lost. 3) Farmers are cultivators. They use precise technology to know exactly how much water a plant needs to grow. Too much could mean poor production. 4) Many farmers rely on Mother Nature for water.

Why is it that in kigezi region most especially kabale they do not plant cassava ?,"The decision not to plant cassava in a particular region like Kigezi, especially in Kabale, can be influenced by various factors such as climate, soil conditions, market demand, cultural preferences, and available resources. Cassava is a tropical crop that requires warm temperatures and well-drained soils to thrive. In regions with cooler temperatures or excessive rainfall, cassava may not grow well or yield satisfactory results. Additionally, farmers in certain areas may prioritize other crops that are better adapted to the local conditions or that have higher market value. It's important to consider the specific agro-ecological conditions and local farming practices when determining crop suitability for a particular region."

Where can we get fertilizer on low price for maize?,"Agricultural input suppliers: Visit local agricultural input suppliers or agro-dealers in your area. They often offer a range of fertilizers, including both synthetic and organic options, at competitive prices. Inquire about any discounts or promotions they may have.

Farmer cooperatives: Joining a farmer cooperative or collective can provide access to bulk purchasing and discounted prices on agricultural inputs, including fertilizers. Cooperative members often benefit from collective bargaining power and can negotiate better prices with suppliers.

Government subsidies or programs: In some countries, governments may offer subsidies or support programs for agricultural inputs, including fertilizers. Check with local agricultural extension services or government agricultural agencies to see if there are any such programs available in your area.

Local composting or organic waste initiatives: If you are interested in organic fertilizers, consider exploring local composting initiatives or organic waste management programs. These initiatives may offer compost or organic fertilizers at lower prices or even for free, as they aim to promote sustainable waste management practices."
"what are difference between Nase 14, Nase 3, and Nase 9 are different varieties of cassava.","Maturity period: Nase 14 is an early-maturing variety, typically reaching maturity in about 9-12 months after planting. Nase 3 and Nase 9 are mid-late maturing varieties, taking around 12-15 months to mature.

Yield potential: Nase 14 is known for its high yield potential, producing a good amount of cassava roots per unit area. Nase 3 and Nase 9 also have decent yield potential but may be slightly lower compared to Nase 14.

Pest and disease resistance: Nase 14 has shown good resistance to major pests and diseases that affect cassava, such as cassava mosaic disease and cassava bacterial blight. Nase 3 and Nase 9 also exhibit some level of resistance but may be relatively less resistant compared to Nase 14.

Root quality: The root qualities of these varieties may vary. Nase 14 is known for its relatively higher starch content, which is desirable for certain cassava-based products. Nase 3 and Nase 9 may have similar or slightly lower starch content but can still provide good quality roots.

Adaptability: These varieties have been bred to be adaptable to different agro-ecological zones. However, their specific adaptability may vary, and it is recommended to select the variety that suits the specific growing conditions of the area."
