"For small-to-midsize biogas plants with simple design and pipe lengths of less than 30 meters, pipes with nominal dimensions of 1/2"" or 3/4"" are recommended.",What are the recommended pipe dimensions for small-to-midsize biogas plants?,"Pipes with nominal dimensions of 1/2"" or 3/4"" are adequate for small-to-midsize plants of simple design and pipe lengths of less than 30 m."
"Special attention must be paid to gas-tight, friction-type joints, line drainage with a water trap, and protection against mechanical impact when installing a gas pipe.",What special attention must be paid when installing a gas pipe?,"When installing a gas pipe, special attention must be paid to Gas-tight, friction-type joints, Line drainage, i.e. with a water trap at the lowest point of the sloping pipe in order to empty water accumulation, Protection against mechanical impact."
Cattle dung is suitable for biogas plants because it contains methane-producing bacteria already present in the stomach of ruminants.,Why is cattle dung suitable for biogas plants?,Cattle dung is the most suitable material for biogas plants because of the methane producing bacteria already contained in the stomach of ruminants.
"The specific gas production from cattle dung is lower, and the methane proportion is around 65% due to prefermentation in the ruminant's stomach.",What is the specific gas production and methane proportion from cattle dung?,"The specific gas production, however, is lower and the proportion of methane is around 65% because of prefermentation in the stomach (Fig. 2.9)."
UV-resistance is crucial for flexible gas pipes laid in the open to prevent degradation and ensure durability under sun exposure.,Why is UV-resistance important for flexible gas pipes laid in the open?,Flexible gas pipes laid in the open must be UV-resistant.
Prefermentation in the ruminant's stomach is significant because it lowers specific gas production and results in a methane proportion of around 65%.,Why is prefermentation in the stomach of ruminants significant for biogas production?,"The specific gas production, however, is lower and the proportion of methane is around 65% because of prefermentation in the stomach (Fig. 2.9)."
