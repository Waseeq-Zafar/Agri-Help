This design also helps break up surface scum during drum rotation.",How are floating-drum gas holders constructed for increased structural stability?,Structural stability is provided by L-bar bracing that also serves to break up surface scum when the drum is rotated. A guide frame stabilizes the gas drum and prevents it from tilting and rubbing against the masonry.
"Different guide frames in floating-drum gas holders provide specific advantages: the internal rod & pipe guide with a fixed cross pole is beneficial when paired with an internal gas outlet, while the external guide frame's support on three wooden or steel lags ensures stability.",What are the advantages of different types of guide frames used in floating-drum gas holders?,The two equally suitable and most frequently used types are: i. An internal rod & pipe guide with a fixed (concrete-embedded) cross pole (an advantageous configuration in connection with an internal gas outlet). ii. External guide frame supported on three wooden or steel lags.
"Substantial force is occasionally needed to rotate the drum in floating-drum gas holders, especially when the drum is stuck in a heavy layer of floating scum. This is due to the resistance posed by the accumulated scum, making rotation difficult.",Why is substantial force sometimes necessary to rotate the drum in floating-drum gas holders?,"For either design, substantial force can be necessary to rotate the drum, especially if it is stuck in a heavy layer of floating scum."
"For the longevity of gasholders, thorough surface protection is crucial, which involves de-rusting and de-soiling, applying a primer coat with a minimum of 2 layers, followed by 2 or 3 cover coats of plastic or bituminous paint. This process helps mitigate rusting and wear.",What type of surface protection is essential for the longevity of gasholders?,"Consequently, a long service life requires proper surface protection, including thorough de-rusting and de-soiling, primer coat of minimum 2 layers and 2 or 3 cover coats of plastic or bituminous paint."
"Steel used in constructing gasholders is highly susceptible to moisture-induced rusting both inside and outside. Hence, ensuring a long service life requires comprehensive surface protection procedures, including de-rusting, de-soiling, and applying multiple layers of primer and protective paint.",What specific considerations are essential when using steel for constructing gasholders?,"All grades of steel normally used for gas–holders are susceptible to moisture–induced rusting both in–and outside. Consequently, a long service life requires proper surface protection, including thorough de-rusting and de-soiling, primer coat of minimum 2 layers and 2 or 3 cover coats of plastic or bituminous paint."
"The internal rod & pipe guide with a fixed cross pole in floating-drum gas holders provides a stabilized configuration beneficial for connections with an internal gas outlet. This design ensures that the internal components remain stable and aligned, enhancing durability and functionality.",How does the internal rod & pipe guide with a fixed cross pole benefit floating-drum gas holders?,The two equally suitable and most frequently used types are: i. An internal rod & pipe guide with a fixed (concrete-embedded) cross pole (an advantageous configuration in connection with an internal gas outlet).
