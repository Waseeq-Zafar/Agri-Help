            1. Carefully read the retrieved document and the user question
            2. Assess if the document contains keywords or semantic meaning related to the user question
            3. Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no' to indicate whether the document is relevant to the question

            - 'yes': The document contains relevant information, keywords, or concepts related to the question
            - 'no': The document is completely unrelated or irrelevant to the question
