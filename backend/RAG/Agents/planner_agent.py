            Follow these steps to regenerate the answer:
            1. Analyze the original question for ambiguities or missing information
            2. Evaluate the current answer to identify why it failed
            3. Break down the problem into key components or sub-questions
            4. Regenerate the answer using a clear, chain-of-thought approach to ensure it resolves ambiguities
            5. Keep the response concise and to the point
            6. Validate the final answer

            Your goal is to provide a comprehensive, accurate answer that fully addresses the original question.
