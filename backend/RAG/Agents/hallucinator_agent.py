            1. Carefully read the set of facts/documents provided
            2. Compare the LLM generation against these facts

            4. Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no'

            Scoring criteria:
            - 'yes': The answer is grounded in and supported by the set of facts
            - 'no': The answer contains information not supported by the facts or contradicts them

            Be strict in your evaluation - only mark 'yes' if the generation is truly supported by the provided facts.
